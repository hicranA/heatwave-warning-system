# Global Heatwave Warning Systems Analysis

## Introduction

Heatwaves are extreme weather events with significant impacts on public health and economies globally. With the intensification of these events due to climate change, establishing efficient and timely heatwave warning systems has become a priority. This research project aims to understand the global landscape of heatwave preparedness, focusing on identifying countries with operational heatwave warning systems.

## Problem Statement

Recognizing the critical need to protect vulnerable populations from the adverse effects of extreme heat, the establishment of effective Heat Warning Systems (HWS) is now a priority. The existing Heatwave Warning Systems Inventory developed by WMO is the primary source for understanding the HWS global distribution. However, it's incomplete, making it challenging to ascertain the extent of global preparedness for heatwaves. This research seeks to bridge this gap.

### Research Questions

1. Which specific countries or regions are documented in the WMO's database as having HWS?
2. Based on external data sources, which countries or regions have HWS but are not listed in the WMO's database?
3. What percentage of countries globally have implemented HWS, and how does this distribution vary by region?
4. Is there a discernible pattern between a country's income level (e.g., low, middle, high income) and the presence or absence of an HWS?

## Technical Details

### Data Sources

- **WMO's Heatwave Warning Systems Inventory**: Primary source for understanding the HWS global distribution.
- **[Name of the External Data Source]**: Used to cross-verify and supplement the information from WMO's database.
