The association between heatwaves and elderly mortality is highly researched in developed countries. In contrast, heatwave impact on hospital admissions has been insufficiently studied worldwide due to data availability and sensitivity. In our opinion, the relationship between heatwaves and hospital admissions is worthwhile to explore as it could have a profound impact on healthcare systems. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the associations between heatwaves and hospitalisations for the elderly by age group in Selangor, Malaysia, from 2010 to 2020. We further explored the impact of heatwaves on the risks of cause-specific hospital admissions across age groups within the elderly. This study applied generalized additive models (GAMs) with the Poisson family and distributed lag models (DLMs) to estimate the effect of heatwaves on hospitalisations. According to the findings, there was no significant increase in hospitalisations for those aged 60 and older during heatwaves; however, a rise in mean apparent temperature (ATmean) by 1 °C significantly increased the risk of hospital admission by 12.9%. Heatwaves had no immediate effects on hospital admissions among elderly patients, but significant delay effects were identified for ATmean with a lag of 0-3 days. The hospital admission rates of the elderly groups started declining after a 5-day average following the heatwave event. Females were found to be relatively more vulnerable than males during heatwave periods. Consequently, these results can provide a reference to improve public health strategies to target elderly people who are at the greatest risk of hospitalisations due to heatwaves.

Considerably less is known about how rising sea surface temperatures will impact the microbiology of wild fish populations, particularly those within estuarine systems that are more vulnerable to warming. We used a combination of Vibrio-specific quantitative PCR and amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA and hsp60 genes to examine seawater and fish (Pelates sexlineatus) gut microbial communities across a quasi-natural experimental system, where thermal pollution from coal-fired power stations creates a temperature gradient of up to 6\xa0°C, compatible with future predicted temperature increases. At the warmest site, fish hindgut microbial communities were in a state of dysbiosis characterised by shifts in beta diversity and a proliferation (71.5% relative abundance) of the potential fish pathogen Photobacterium damselae subsp. damselae. Comparable patterns were not identified in the surrounding seawater, indicating opportunistic proliferation within estuarine fish guts under thermal stress. A subsequent evaluation of predicted future warming-related risk due to pathogenic Vibrionaceae in temperate estuarine fish demonstrated that warming is likely to drive opportunistic pathogen increases in the upper latitudinal range of this estuarine fish, potentially impacting adaptations to future warming.

Using an extensive time series of co-located reef fish community structure and habitat data spanning 12 years and the entire Australian continent, we found that reef fish community responses to changing temperatures and habitats are dynamic and widespread but regionally patchy. Shifts in composition and abundance of the fish community often occurred within 2 years of environmental or habitat change, although the relative importance of these two mechanisms of climate impact tended to differ between tropical and temperate zones. The clearest of these changes on temperate and subtropical reefs were temperature related, with responses measured by the reef fish thermal index indicating reshuffling according to the thermal affinities of species present.

The associations of CC, air pollution and other environmental exposures with childhood asthma are attracting more research attention, but relatively few studies have focused on CC adaptation measures and childhood asthma. This study aimed to bridge this knowledge gap and conducted the first systematic review on CC adaptation measures and childhood asthma. We searched electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science using a set of MeSH terms and related synonyms, and identified 20 eligible studies included for review. We found that there were a number of adaptation measures proposed for childhood asthma in response to GCC, including vulnerability assessment, improving ventilation and heating, enhancing community education, and developing forecast models and early warning systems. Several randomized controlled trials show that improving ventilation and installing heating in the homes appear to be an effective way to relieve childhood asthma symptoms, especially in winter. However, the effectiveness of most adaptation measures, except for improving ventilation and heating, have not been explored and quantified. Given more extreme weather events (e.g., cold spells and heatwaves) may occur as climate change progresses, this finding may have important implications. Evidently, further research is urgently warranted to evaluate the impacts of CC adaptation measures on childhood asthma.

BVOCs are emitted by plants in a rapid protective response to abiotic stress, mediated by the energetic status of leaves (the excess of reducing power when photosynthetic light and dark reactions are decoupled, as occurs when stomata close in response to water stress). Emissions also increase exponentially with leaf temperature. New analytical methods for the detection of spatiotemporally contiguous extremes in remote-sensing data are applied here to satellite-derived atmospheric HCHO columns.

Imposing experimental water deficits is key to gaining this understanding, but has been hindered by logistic difficulties in maintaining consistently low water availability for plants. Here, we describe a simple method for applying soil water deficits to potted plants in glasshouse experiments. We modified an existing method (the ""Snow and Tingey system"") in order to apply a gradual, moderate water deficit to 50 plant species of different life forms (grasses, vines, shrubs, trees). The method requires less maintenance and manual handling compared to other water deficit methods, so it can be used for extended periods of time and is relatively inexpensive to implement. With only a few modifications, it is possible to easily establish and maintain soil water deficits of differing intensity and duration, as well as to incorporate interacting stress factors. We tested this method by measuring physiological responses to an applied water deficit in a subset of 11 tree/shrub species with a wide range of drought tolerances and water-use strategies. For this subgroup of species, stomatal conductance was 2-17 times lower in droughted plants than controls, although only half of the species (5 out of 11) experienced midday leaf water potentials that exceeded their turgor loss (i.e., wilting) point. Leaf temperatures were up to 8°C higher in droughted plants than controls, indicating that droughted plants are at greater risk of thermal damage, relative to unstressed plants. The largest leaf temperature differences (between droughted and well-watered plants) were in species with high rates of water loss. Rapid osmotic adjustment was observed in leaves of five species when drought stress was combined with an experimental heatwave.

Heatwaves are predicted to increase, and it is of vital importance to generate crops that are tolerant to not only heat stress but also to several other abiotic stresses (e.g. drought stress, salinity stress) to ensure that global food security is protected. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the temperature stress response in pollen will be a significant step towards developing effective breeding strategies for high and stable production in crop plants. While most studies have focused on the vegetative phase of plant growth to understand heat stress tolerance, it is the reproductive phase that requires more attention as it is more sensitive to elevated temperatures. Every phase of reproductive development is affected by environmental challenges, including pollen and ovule development, pollen tube growth, male-female cross-talk, fertilization, and embryo development. In this review we summarize how pollen is affected by heat stress and the molecular mechanisms employed during the stress period, as revealed by classical and -omics experiments.', 'link': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33818773/', 'source': 'pubmed'}, {'id': 141, 'authors': 'Elisabeth Anne-Sophie Mayrhuber, Michel L A Dückers, Peter Wallner, Arne Arnberger, Brigitte Allex, Laura Wiesböck, Anna Wanka, Franz Kolland, Renate Eder, Hans-Peter Hutter, Ruth Kutalek', 'title': 'Vulnerability to heatwaves and implications for public health interventions - A scoping review.', 'predicted_label': '0', 'abstract': 'Heatwaves form a serious public health threat, especially for vulnerable groups.

Variability in formaldehyde (HCHO) concentrations in the troposphere is dominated by local emissions of short-lived biogenic (BVOC) and pyrogenic volatile organic compounds. BVOCs are emitted by plants in a rapid protective response to abiotic stress, mediated by the energetic status of leaves (the excess of reducing power when photosynthetic light and dark reactions are decoupled, as occurs when stomata close in response to water stress). Emissions also increase exponentially with leaf temperature. New analytical methods for the detection of spatiotemporally contiguous extremes in remote-sensing data are applied here to satellite-derived atmospheric HCHO columns.

Moreover, phase shifts in this region have mostly been characterized by the emergence of algae and, less typically, zoantharians. However, nutrient excess and organic pollution are key drivers of the hard coral habitat degradation and may, thus, favor the emergence of novel zoantharian-dominated habitats. Many zoantharian species, particularly those from the genera Palythoa and Zoanthus, have traits that could help them thrive under conditions detrimental to reef-building corals, including rapid growth, several asexual reproduction strategies, high morphological plasticity, and generalist nutrient acquisition strategies. Thus, in a near future, stress-tolerant zoantharians may thrive in nutrient-enriched subtidal SWA locations under low heat stress, such as, upwelling. Overall, coral-zoantharian phase shifts in the SWA may decrease the species richness of reef communities, ultimately influencing ecosystem functioning and services, such as the provision of nursery habitats, fish biomass production, and coastline protection. However, zoantharians will also be threatened at intertidal zones, which are expected to experience higher heat stress, solar radiation, and sea-level rise. Although zoantharians appear to cope well with some local stressors (e.g., decreasing water quality), they are vulnerable to climate change (e.g., heatwaves), invasive species (Tubastraea spp.), microplastics, diseases, and mostly restricted to a narrow depth range (0-15\xa0m depth) in SWA reefs. This shallow zone is particularly affected by climate change, compressing the three-dimensional habitat and limiting depth refugia in deeper SWA reefs. As mesophotic ecosystems have been hypothesized as short-term refuges to disturbances for some species, the narrow depth limit of zoantharians seems to be a potential factor that might increase their vulnerability to growing climate change pressures in SWA shallow-water reefs. Together, these could lead to both range expansions in some locations and loss of suitable reef habitats in other sites. Additional research is needed to better understand the systemic responses of these novel SWA reefs to the concert of increasing and interactive local and global stressors, and their implications for ecosystem functioning and service provisions.', 'link': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34879290/', 'source': 'pubmed'}, {'id': 14, 'authors': 'Alex Sen Gupta, Mads Thomsen, Jessica A Benthuysen, Alistair J Hobday, Eric Oliver, Lisa V Alexander, Michael T Burrows, Markus G Donat, Ming Feng, Neil J Holbrook, Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, Pippa J Moore, Regina R Rodrigues, Hillary A Scannell, Andréa S Taschetto, Caroline C Ummenhofer, Thomas Wernberg, Dan A Smale', 'title': 'Drivers and impacts of the most extreme marine heatwaves events.', 'predicted_label': '0', 'abstract': 'Prolonged high-temperature extreme events in the ocean, marine heatwaves, can have severe and long-lasting impacts on marine ecosystems, fisheries and associated services.

Most subtropical extreme marine heatwaves were triggered by persistent atmospheric high-pressure systems and anomalously weak wind speeds, associated with increased insolation, and reduced ocean heat losses.

Using an extensive time series of co-located reef fish community structure and habitat data spanning 12 years and the entire Australian continent, we found that reef fish community responses to changing temperatures and habitats are dynamic and widespread but regionally patchy. Shifts in composition and abundance of the fish community often occurred within 2 years of environmental or habitat change, although the relative importance of these two mechanisms of climate impact tended to differ between tropical and temperate zones. The clearest of these changes on temperate and subtropical reefs were temperature related, with responses measured by the reef fish thermal index indicating reshuffling according to the thermal affinities of species present. On low latitude coral reefs, the community generalization index indicated shifting dominance of habitat generalist fishes through time, concurrent with changing coral cover. Our results emphasize the importance of maintaining local ecological detail when scaling up datasets to inform national policies and global biodiversity targets.

Our investigation highlights the importance of external dFe supply during marine heatwave events, as a more shallow mixed layer reduces the transport of essential (micro)macronutrients to the surface layer. We conclude that recycled dFe did not contribute to NCP in 2014, but rather the vertical displacement of dFe rich water unrelated to mixed layer deepening played a major role.

Health peaks represent a heavy burden for the public health system; they are, however, usually studied specifically when they occur (e.g., the European 2003 heatwave). Specific analyses are needed, using appropriate statistical tools. Quantile regression can provide such analysis by focusing not only on the conditional median, but on different conditional quantiles of the dependent variable.

In this study, quantile regression is used to model the relationships between conditional quantiles of cardiovascular variables and meteorological variables in Montreal (Canada), focusing on health peaks. Results show that meteorological impacts are not constant throughout the conditional quantiles. They are stronger in health peaks compared to quantiles around the median.

Temperature and salinity are among the most relevant drivers in estuaries, shaping species growth, reproduction and distribution.

Here, we tested how salinity could shape the response of ragworms Hediste diversicolor, an important bioindicator and commercial species, to elevated temperature. We exposed polychaetes to three temperatures for a month, simulating control, ocean warming and heatwave conditions (24, 27 and 30 °C, respectively) combined with two salinities (20 and 30). We quantified whole-organism performance (wet weight gain and survival), along with cellular stress response (CSR) and energy reserves of worms after 14 and 28 days of exposure. Significant three-way interactions between temperature, salinity and exposure time show the non-linearity of molecular responses. Worms at a salinity of 20 were more sensitive to warming than worms exposed to a salinity of 30. The combination of high temperature and low salinity can act synergistically to induce oxidative stress and macromolecular damage in worm tissues. This finding was supported by an induction of the CSR, with a concomitant decrease of energy reserves, pointing towards a metabolic compensation strategy. However, under a higher salinity (30), the need for a CSR upon thermal challenge was reduced and energy content increased with temperature, which suggests that environmental conditions were within the optimum range. Heatwaves striking low-salinity areas of estuaries can therefore negatively impact the cellular physiology of H. diversicolor, with greater metabolic costs. However, extreme stress levels were not reached as worms incremented wet weight and survival was high under all conditions tested.

Although compensatory changes in age structure, size, growth or energy content of forage fish were observed to varying degrees among all these forage fish, none were able to fully mitigate adverse impacts of the heatwave, which likely included both top-down and bottom-up forcing. Notably, changes to the demographic structure of forage fish suggested size-selective removals typical of top-down regulation. At the same time, changes in zooplankton communities may have driven bottom-up regulation as copepod community structure shifted toward smaller, warm water species, and euphausiid biomass was reduced owing to the loss of cold-water species. Mediated by these impacts on the forage fish community, an unprecedented disruption of the normal pelagic food web was signaled by higher trophic level disruptions during 2015-2016, when seabirds, marine mammals, and groundfish experienced shifts in distribution, mass mortalities, and reproductive failures. Unlike decadal-scale variability underlying ecosystem regime shifts, the heatwave appeared to temporarily overwhelm the ability of the forage fish community to buffer against changes imposed by warm water anomalies, thereby eliminating any ecological advantages that may have accrued from having a suite of coexisting forage species with differing life-history compensations.', 'link': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33577102/', 'source': 'pubmed'}, {'id': 95, 'authors': 'Alex Sen Gupta, Mads Thomsen, Jessica A Benthuysen, Alistair J Hobday, Eric Oliver, Lisa V Alexander, Michael T Burrows, Markus G Donat, Ming Feng, Neil J Holbrook, Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, Pippa J Moore, Regina R Rodrigues, Hillary A Scannell, Andréa S Taschetto, Caroline C Ummenhofer, Thomas Wernberg, Dan A Smale', 'title': 'Drivers and impacts of the most extreme marine heatwaves events.', 'predicted_label': '0', 'abstract': 'Prolonged high-temperature extreme events in the ocean, marine heatwaves, can have severe and long-lasting impacts on marine ecosystems, fisheries and associated services.

However, it is still unclear how plant phenology and physiology can be integrated to explain the spatiotemporal variability of terrestrial GPP. Based on analyses of eddy-covariance and satellite-derived data, we decomposed annual terrestrial GPP into the length of the CO2 uptake period (CUP) and the seasonal maximal capacity of CO2 uptake (GPPmax). The product of CUP and GPPmax explained >90% of the temporal GPP variability in most areas of North America during 2000-2010 and the spatial GPP variation among globally distributed eddy flux tower sites. It also explained GPP response to the European heatwave in 2003 (r(2) = 0.90) and GPP recovery after a fire disturbance in South Dakota (r(2) = 0.88). Additional analysis of the eddy-covariance flux data shows that the interbiome variation in annual GPP is better explained by that in GPPmax than CUP.

Based on evidence-based thinking, our study combs the research progress of heat-health early warning from four aspects: early warning indicators, early warning models, early warning thresholds, and early warning ranks, and clarifies the key points of the construction of heat-health early warning models and rank schemes, in order to provide early warning technology for the rapid development of national heat-heath early warning in China."", 'link': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36274614/', 'source': 'pubmed'}, {'id': 306, 'authors': 'Huiqi Chen, Liang Zhao, Liangliang Cheng, Yali Zhang, Huibin Wang, Kuiying Gu, Junzhe Bao, Jun Yang, Zhao Liu, Jianbin Huang, Yidan Chen, Xuejie Gao, Ying Xu, Can Wang, Wenjia Cai, Peng Gong, Yong Luo, Wannian Liang, Cunrui Huang', 'title': 'Projections of heatwave-attributable mortality under climate change and future population scenarios in China.', 'predicted_label': '0', 'abstract': 'In China, most previous projections of heat-related mortality have been based on modeling studies using global climate models (GCMs), which can help to elucidate the risks of extreme heat events in a changing climate.

The associations of CC, air pollution and other environmental exposures with childhood asthma are attracting more research attention, but relatively few studies have focused on CC adaptation measures and childhood asthma. This study aimed to bridge this knowledge gap and conducted the first systematic review on CC adaptation measures and childhood asthma. We searched electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science using a set of MeSH terms and related synonyms, and identified 20 eligible studies included for review. We found that there were a number of adaptation measures proposed for childhood asthma in response to GCC, including vulnerability assessment, improving ventilation and heating, enhancing community education, and developing forecast models and early warning systems. Several randomized controlled trials show that improving ventilation and installing heating in the homes appear to be an effective way to relieve childhood asthma symptoms, especially in winter. However, the effectiveness of most adaptation measures, except for improving ventilation and heating, have not been explored and quantified. Given more extreme weather events (e.g., cold spells and heatwaves) may occur as climate change progresses, this finding may have important implications. Evidently, further research is urgently warranted to evaluate the impacts of CC adaptation measures on childhood asthma. These adaptation measures, if proven to be effective, should be integrated in childhood asthma control and prevention programs as GCC continues.', 'link': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35644404/', 'source': 'pubmed'}, {'id': 309, 'authors': 'Stanley Kin Nok Chan, Sneha Suresh, Phillip Munday, Timothy Ravasi, Moisés A Bernal, Celia Schunter', 'title': 'The alternative splicing landscape of a coral reef fish during a marine heatwave.', 'predicted_label': '0', 'abstract': 'Alternative splicing is a molecular mechanism that enables a single gene to encode multiple transcripts and proteins by post-transcriptional modification of pre-RNA molecules.

BVOCs are emitted by plants in a rapid protective response to abiotic stress, mediated by the energetic status of leaves (the excess of reducing power when photosynthetic light and dark reactions are decoupled, as occurs when stomata close in response to water stress). Emissions also increase exponentially with leaf temperature. New analytical methods for the detection of spatiotemporally contiguous extremes in remote-sensing data are applied here to satellite-derived atmospheric HCHO columns.

The performance of these warning systems has rarely been evaluated with actual heat-health data, especially the morbidity data, in regions with severe impact. In this study, we assessed the performance of the Shanghai HHWS based on heat-related illness data collected by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) and then conducted a comparative analysis among the Shanghai HHWS, the China Meteorological Administration HHWS, the Chinese national standard for heatwave indexes, the heat index adopted by the USA\'s National Weather Service and the definition suggested by the World Meteorological Organization to understand their potential performance for application in Shanghai and to evaluate the temperature thresholds and different meteorological indices employed. The results show that: 1) during the research period, 50% of heat-related illnesses and 58.2% of heat-related deaths in Shanghai occurred on dates that had no heat warnings; 2) for the current threshold (35\xa0°C), the single metric of temperature outperformed the temperature-duration two-parameter method; 3) different from existing studies, while infants and seniors are deemed as vulnerable population groups to heat, young and middle-aged males were found to suffer more heat-related illnesses in hot weather. More detailed analyses reveal that the performance of heat-health warning systems needs to be evaluated and revised periodically, and warning thresholds utilized must be localized to reflect public tolerance to heat and to address the vulnerability of target population groups. Temperature is the dominant threshold in heat-related morbidity and mortality analysis. While a decrease in the temperature threshold would definitely increase the warning frequency and socioeconomic costs, it might also cause warning fatigue. The trade-off between these two aspects is essential for decision-makers and other stakeholders in HHWS design and improvement.', 'link': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32006779/', 'source': 'pubmed'}]"

Over the last 20\xa0years, three major coral bleaching events occurred in concomitance with anomalous heatwaves, provoking a severe loss of coral cover worldwide. The conservation strategies for preserving reefs, as they are implemented now, cannot cope with global climatic shifts. Consequently, researchers are advocating for preservation networks to be set-up to reinforce coral adaptive potential. However, the main obstacle to this implementation is that studies on coral adaption are usually hard to generalize at the scale of a reef system. Here, we study the relationships between genotype frequencies and environmental characteristics of the sea (seascape genomics), in combination with connectivity analysis, to investigate the adaptive potential of a flagship coral species of the Ryukyu Archipelago (Japan). By associating genotype frequencies with descriptors of historical environmental conditions, we discovered six genomic regions hosting polymorphisms that might promote resistance against heat stress. Remarkably, annotations of genes in these regions were consistent with molecular roles associated with heat responses. Furthermore, we combined information on genetic and spatial distances between reefs to predict connectivity at a regional scale. The combination of these results portrayed the adaptive potential of this population: we were able to identify reefs carrying potential heat stress adapted genotypes and to understand how they disperse to neighbouring reefs. This information was summarized by objective, quantifiable and mappable indices covering the whole region, which can be extremely useful for future prioritization of reefs in conservation planning.

Herbivorous insects and their natural enemies belong to some of the largest groups of terrestrial animals, and thus they have a great impact on the functioning of ecosystems and on the services these ecosystems provide. Here we studied the life history traits of the plant-feeding insect Plutella xylostella and its specialist endoparasitoid Diadegma semiclausum, when exposed to a daily heat pulse of 5 or 10°C temperature increase during their entire immature phase. Growth and developmental responses differed with the amplitude of the heat pulse and they were different between host and parasitoid, indicating different thermal sensitivity of the two trophic levels. With a +5°C heat pulse, the adult parasitoids were larger which may result in a higher fitness, whereas a +10°C heat pulse retarded parasitoid development. These results show that the parasitoid is more sensitive than its host to brief intervals of temperature change, and this results in either positive or negative effects on life history traits, depending on the amplitude of the heat pulse.

However, less is understood about the adverse effects of extreme heat amongst specific cardiovascular diseases (i.e., heart failure, dysrhythmias) and demographics (sex, ethnicity, age) within Australia and New Zealand.

Moreover, phase shifts in this region have mostly been characterized by the emergence of algae and, less typically, zoantharians. However, nutrient excess and organic pollution are key drivers of the hard coral habitat degradation and may, thus, favor the emergence of novel zoantharian-dominated habitats. Many zoantharian species, particularly those from the genera Palythoa and Zoanthus, have traits that could help them thrive under conditions detrimental to reef-building corals, including rapid growth, several asexual reproduction strategies, high morphological plasticity, and generalist nutrient acquisition strategies. Thus, in a near future, stress-tolerant zoantharians may thrive in nutrient-enriched subtidal SWA locations under low heat stress, such as, upwelling. Overall, coral-zoantharian phase shifts in the SWA may decrease the species richness of reef communities, ultimately influencing ecosystem functioning and services, such as the provision of nursery habitats, fish biomass production, and coastline protection. However, zoantharians will also be threatened at intertidal zones, which are expected to experience higher heat stress, solar radiation, and sea-level rise. Although zoantharians appear to cope well with some local stressors (e.g., decreasing water quality), they are vulnerable to climate change (e.g., heatwaves), invasive species (Tubastraea spp.), microplastics, diseases, and mostly restricted to a narrow depth range (0-15\xa0m depth) in SWA reefs. This shallow zone is particularly affected by climate change, compressing the three-dimensional habitat and limiting depth refugia in deeper SWA reefs. As mesophotic ecosystems have been hypothesized as short-term refuges to disturbances for some species, the narrow depth limit of zoantharians seems to be a potential factor that might increase their vulnerability to growing climate change pressures in SWA shallow-water reefs. Together, these could lead to both range expansions in some locations and loss of suitable reef habitats in other sites. Additional research is needed to better understand the systemic responses of these novel SWA reefs to the concert of increasing and interactive local and global stressors, and their implications for ecosystem functioning and service provisions.', 'link': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34879290/', 'source': 'pubmed'}, {'id': 112, 'authors': 'Romy Rehschuh, Nadine K Ruehr', 'title': 'Diverging responses of water and carbon relations during and after heat and hot drought stress in Pinus sylvestris.', 'predicted_label': '0', 'abstract': ""Forests are increasingly affected by heatwaves, often co-occurring with drought, with consequences for water and carbon (C) cycling. However, our ability to project tree resilience to more intense hot droughts remains limited. Here, we used single tree chambers (n\xa0=\xa018) to investigate transpiration (E), net assimilation (Anet), root respiration (Rroot) and stem diameter change in Scots pine seedlings in a control treatment and during gradually intensifying heat or drought-heat stress (max. 42\xa0°C), including recovery. Alongside this, we assessed indicators of stress impacts and recovery capacities. In the heat treatment, excessive leaf heating was mitigated via increased E, while under drought-heat, E ceased and leaf temperatures reached 46\xa0°C. However, leaf electrolyte leakage was negligible, while light-adapted quantum yield of photosystem II (F'v/F'm) declined alongside Anet moderately in heat, but strongly in drought-heat seedlings, in which respiration exceeded C uptake. Drought-heat largely affected the hydraulic system as apparent in stem diameter shrinkage, declining relative needle water content (RWCNeedle) and water potential (ΨNeedle) reaching -2.7\xa0MPa, alongside a 90% decline of leaf hydraulic conductance (KLeaf). Heat alone resulted in low functional impairment and all measured parameters recovered quickly. Contrary, following drought-heat, the recovery of KLeaf was incomplete and stem hydraulic conductivity (KS) was 25% lower than the control. However, F'v/F'm recovered and the tree net C balance reached control values 2\xa0days post-stress, with stem increment rates accelerating during the second recovery week. This indicates a new equilibrium of C uptake and release in drought-heat seedlings independent of hydraulic impairment, which may slowly contribute to the repair of damaged tissues. In summary, Scots pine recovered rapidly following moderate heat stress, while combined with drought, hydraulic and thermal stress intensified, resulting in functional damage and slow recovery of hydraulic conductance.

Owing to the growing concern of rising temperatures, we analyzed the potential response in a number of river sections that are subject to hydropeaking and thermopeaking through the intermittent release of water from hydropower stations. Thermopeaking in alpine streams is known to intermittently cool down the river water in summer and to warm it up in winter. We analyzed the response of river water temperature to air temperature during heatwaves at 19 gauging stations across Switzerland, using a 30-yr dataset at a 10-min resolution. Stations were either classified into ""unpeaked"" or ""peaked"" groups according to four statistical indicators related to hydropeaking and thermopeaking pressure. Peaked stations were exposed to reduced temporal variability in river water temperature, and it was determined that correlations between river water and air temperature were weaker for peaked stations compared with unpeaked stations. Similarly, peaked stations showed a much weaker response to heatwaves compared with unpeaked stations. It is important to note that this ""cooling effect"" created by hydro-thermopeaking was most pronounced during the two major heatwave events that took place in 2003 and 2006. Furthermore, results from thermal stress events on the growth of a typical cold eurythermic fish species (brown trout) increased continuously in rivers subject to peaked station water release during heatwaves.

We find that in extended summer months, the MHWs at tropical and subtropical reefs (divided at ~20°S) are driven by opposite ENSO polarities: MHWs are more likely to occur at the tropical reefs during eastern Pacific El Niño, driven by enhanced solar radiation and weaker Australian Monsoon, some likely alleviated by positive Indian Ocean Dipole events, and at the subtropical reefs during central Pacific La Niña, mainly caused by increased horizontal heat transport, and in some cases reinforced by local air-sea interactions. Madden-Julian Oscillations (MJO) also modulate the MHW occurrences. Projected future increases in ENSO and MJO intensity with greenhouse warming will enhance thermal stress across the SEIO.

To predict the interactions between urban overheating and HWs, the surface energy balance response to HWs is crucial. HW is a regional phenomenon and the climatic conditions may influence the local conditions to alter the energy budget contrast between a city and its adjacent peripheral areas. The interactions between the urban overheating and HWs are explored in a coastal city (Sydney Australia), also in the proximity of dry landmass, while considering the site characteristics, distance from the coast, and the population density. A positive response between urban overheating and HWs is reported. Advective heat flux in the form of a dualistic circulation system is found responsible for exacerbating the urban overheating magnitude (ΔT) during the HWs and altering the available energy balance. Land-coastal distance is also found as an important contributor in magnifying the urban-suburban temperature contrast. Considering the future urbanization in western Sydney, surfaces capable of retaining higher moisture content are prescribed to reduce the occurrence of extreme HW events.

The increased risk of these extreme events might have more exposure to the population; thus, it is important to discuss such extreme events and their projected behavior under a changing climate scenario. In the present study, we have computed the extreme precipitation and temperature indices over the 10 agro-climatic zones falling under the Ganga River Basin (GRB)utilizing a high-resolution daily gridded temperature and precipitation multi-model ensembled CMIP6 dataset (0.25°\u2009×\u20090.25°) under global warming levels of 1.5\xa0°C, 2\xa0°C, and 3\xa0°C. We found that the annual daily minimum temperature (TNN) showed a higher rise of about 67% than the maximum temperature (TXX) of 48% in GRB. The basin also experiences a greater increase in the frequency of warm nights (TN90P) of about 67.71% compared to warm days (TX90P) of 29.1% for the 3\xa0°C global warming level. Along with extreme indices, the population exposed due to the impact of the extreme maximum temperature has also been analyzed for progressive warming levels. Population exposure to extreme temperature event (TXX) has been analyzed with 20-year return period using GEV distribution method. The study concludes that the exposed population to extreme temperature event experienced an increase from 46.99 to 52.16% for the whole Ganga Basin. Consecutive dry days (CDD) and consecutive wet days (CWD) both show a significant increasing trend, but CWD has a significant increase in the majority of the zones, while CDD shows a significant decreasing trend for some of the zones for three warming levels periods.

Recent studies have suggested that variability in GPP is driven by a broad range of biotic and abiotic factors operating mainly through changes in vegetation phenology and physiological processes. However, it is still unclear how plant phenology and physiology can be integrated to explain the spatiotemporal variability of terrestrial GPP. Based on analyses of eddy-covariance and satellite-derived data, we decomposed annual terrestrial GPP into the length of the CO2 uptake period (CUP) and the seasonal maximal capacity of CO2 uptake (GPPmax). The product of CUP and GPPmax explained >90% of the temporal GPP variability in most areas of North America during 2000-2010 and the spatial GPP variation among globally distributed eddy flux tower sites. It also explained GPP response to the European heatwave in 2003 (r(2) = 0.90) and GPP recovery after a fire disturbance in South Dakota (r(2) = 0.88). Additional analysis of the eddy-covariance flux data shows that the interbiome variation in annual GPP is better explained by that in GPPmax than CUP. These findings indicate that terrestrial GPP is jointly controlled by ecosystem-level plant phenology and photosynthetic capacity, and greater understanding of GPPmax and CUP responses to environmental and biological variations will, thus, improve predictions of GPP over time and space.', 'link': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25730847/', 'source': 'pubmed'}]"

Along the studied period macrobenthic community showed marked fluctuations, in terms of richness, diversity, biological traits and ecological groups, which could be related with environmental instability of the lagoon. At the same time, a general tendency towards a deterioration of ecological condition of the lagoon was observed, with a general decrease in species richness, diversity, percentage of sensitive species, and a general increase in the proportion of the more opportunistic trait modalities, such as deposit feeders, burrowing, infaunal and short living animals. Increasing yearly temperature explained only a small part of the variability of macrobenthic community, in terms of biological traits and diversity indices, and this was likely due to the effect of natural fluctuations of environmental parameters and anthropogenic disturbance. Nevertheless, all metrics used are consistent in identifying the response of benthic community to a severe disturbance, likely related with the summer heatwave in 2003. Less marked signs of disturbance were observed also in relations to the thermal anomaly of 2012.

Owing to the growing concern of rising temperatures, we analyzed the potential response in a number of river sections that are subject to hydropeaking and thermopeaking through the intermittent release of water from hydropower stations. Thermopeaking in alpine streams is known to intermittently cool down the river water in summer and to warm it up in winter. We analyzed the response of river water temperature to air temperature during heatwaves at 19 gauging stations across Switzerland, using a 30-yr dataset at a 10-min resolution. Stations were either classified into ""unpeaked"" or ""peaked"" groups according to four statistical indicators related to hydropeaking and thermopeaking pressure. Peaked stations were exposed to reduced temporal variability in river water temperature, and it was determined that correlations between river water and air temperature were weaker for peaked stations compared with unpeaked stations. Similarly, peaked stations showed a much weaker response to heatwaves compared with unpeaked stations. It is important to note that this ""cooling effect"" created by hydro-thermopeaking was most pronounced during the two major heatwave events that took place in 2003 and 2006. Furthermore, results from thermal stress events on the growth of a typical cold eurythermic fish species (brown trout) increased continuously in rivers subject to peaked station water release during heatwaves. While hydropower operations that take place high up on mountains releasing hypolimnetic water may mitigate the adverse effects of heatwaves on downstream alpine river ecosystems locally, our results show the complexity of an artificial physical template associated with flow regime regulation in alpine streams.', 'link': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28898932/', 'source': 'pubmed'}, {'id': 193, 'authors': 'Dilek Killi, Filippo Bussotti, Antonio Raschi, Matthew Haworth', 'title': 'Adaptation to high temperature mitigates the impact of water deficit during combined heat and drought stress in C3 sunflower and C4 maize varieties with contrasting drought tolerance.', 'predicted_label': '0', 'abstract': 'Heat and drought stress frequently occur together, however, their impact on plant growth and photosynthesis (P', 'link': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27535211/', 'source': 'pubmed'}, {'id': 194, 'authors': 'Maria Concetta de Pinto, Vittoria Locato, Annalisa Paradiso, Laura De Gara', 'title': 'Role of redox homeostasis in thermo-tolerance under a climate change scenario.', 'predicted_label': '0', 'abstract': 'Climate change predictions indicate a progressive increase in average temperatures and an increase in the frequency of heatwaves, which will have a negative impact on crop productivity.

Recent studies have suggested that variability in GPP is driven by a broad range of biotic and abiotic factors operating mainly through changes in vegetation phenology and physiological processes. However, it is still unclear how plant phenology and physiology can be integrated to explain the spatiotemporal variability of terrestrial GPP. Based on analyses of eddy-covariance and satellite-derived data, we decomposed annual terrestrial GPP into the length of the CO2 uptake period (CUP) and the seasonal maximal capacity of CO2 uptake (GPPmax). The product of CUP and GPPmax explained >90% of the temporal GPP variability in most areas of North America during 2000-2010 and the spatial GPP variation among globally distributed eddy flux tower sites. It also explained GPP response to the European heatwave in 2003 (r(2) = 0.90) and GPP recovery after a fire disturbance in South Dakota (r(2) = 0.88). Additional analysis of the eddy-covariance flux data shows that the interbiome variation in annual GPP is better explained by that in GPPmax than CUP. These findings indicate that terrestrial GPP is jointly controlled by ecosystem-level plant phenology and photosynthetic capacity, and greater understanding of GPPmax and CUP responses to environmental and biological variations will, thus, improve predictions of GPP over time and space.', 'link': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25730847/', 'source': 'pubmed'}, {'id': 196, 'authors': 'Franziska Matthies, Bettina Menne', 'title': 'Prevention and management of health hazards related to heatwaves.', 'predicted_label': '0', 'abstract': 'The general aim of the EuroHEAT project was to improve public health responses to weather extremes and, in particular, to heatwaves.', 'link': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19331238/', 'source': 'pubmed'}, {'id': 197, 'authors': 'Bruno Christian Ciancio, Massimiliano Di Renzi, Nancy Binkin, Alberto Perra, Rosa Prato, Antonino Bella, Paolo Niutta, Fabrizio Rossi, Cinzia Germinario, Maria Teresa Balducci, Giovanni Caputi, Annarita Fusco', 'title': '[Risk factors for mortality during a heat-wave in Bari (Italy), summer 2005.].', 'predicted_label': '0', 'abstract': 'The Italian Heat Health Watch Warning System (HHWWS) was set up following the over 3000 excess deaths which occurred in Italy during the heat wave of 2003, In June 2005 the warning system issued a heat warning in various Italian cities.', 'link': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18223698/', 'source': 'pubmed'}, {'id': 198, 'authors': 'Giuseppe Mastrangelo, Ugo Fedeli, Cristiana Visentin, Giovanni Milan, Emanuela Fadda, Paolo Spolaore', 'title': 'Pattern and determinants of hospitalization during heat waves: an ecologic study.', 'predicted_label': '0', 'abstract': 'Numerous studies have investigated mortality during a heatwave, while few have quantified heat associated morbidity.

The heat stress due to the hot environment is characterized by systemic inflammatory response (as in severe sepsis) and hemodynamic impairment (as in hypovolemic shock). The association between hypovolemia and altered microcirculation leads to cell energy failure with metabolic lactic acidosis. The energy failure may induce structural irreversible damage of mitochondria. It is possible to differentiate, during energy failure, the irreversible or reversible condition by volume loading and vasoactive drugs challenge tests. In fact, if the hemodynamic correction is associated with normalization of SvO2 with disappearance of metabolic acidosis, this suggests hemodynamic impairment with intact mitochondrial function. In contrast, if the hemodynamic improvement with normalization of SvO2 is associated and acidosis persists, this suggests irreversible structural mitochondrial damage. The threshold between reversibility and irreversibility is likely time dependent, as suggested by biochemical consideration and by 2 large randomized studies on hemodynamic treatment. The comparative analysis of these 2 studies suggests that the time of intervention may lead to significant differences in mortality.

Moreover, phase shifts in this region have mostly been characterized by the emergence of algae and, less typically, zoantharians. However, nutrient excess and organic pollution are key drivers of the hard coral habitat degradation and may, thus, favor the emergence of novel zoantharian-dominated habitats. Many zoantharian species, particularly those from the genera Palythoa and Zoanthus, have traits that could help them thrive under conditions detrimental to reef-building corals, including rapid growth, several asexual reproduction strategies, high morphological plasticity, and generalist nutrient acquisition strategies. Thus, in a near future, stress-tolerant zoantharians may thrive in nutrient-enriched subtidal SWA locations under low heat stress, such as, upwelling. Overall, coral-zoantharian phase shifts in the SWA may decrease the species richness of reef communities, ultimately influencing ecosystem functioning and services, such as the provision of nursery habitats, fish biomass production, and coastline protection. However, zoantharians will also be threatened at intertidal zones, which are expected to experience higher heat stress, solar radiation, and sea-level rise. Although zoantharians appear to cope well with some local stressors (e.g., decreasing water quality), they are vulnerable to climate change (e.g., heatwaves), invasive species (Tubastraea spp.), microplastics, diseases, and mostly restricted to a narrow depth range (0-15\xa0m depth) in SWA reefs. This shallow zone is particularly affected by climate change, compressing the three-dimensional habitat and limiting depth refugia in deeper SWA reefs. As mesophotic ecosystems have been hypothesized as short-term refuges to disturbances for some species, the narrow depth limit of zoantharians seems to be a potential factor that might increase their vulnerability to growing climate change pressures in SWA shallow-water reefs. Together, these could lead to both range expansions in some locations and loss of suitable reef habitats in other sites. Additional research is needed to better understand the systemic responses of these novel SWA reefs to the concert of increasing and interactive local and global stressors, and their implications for ecosystem functioning and service provisions.', 'link': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34879290/', 'source': 'pubmed'}, {'id': 217, 'authors': 'Peng Zhang, Jee-Hoon Jeong, Jin-Ho Yoon, Hyungjun Kim, S-Y Simon Wang, Hans W Linderholm, Keyan Fang, Xiuchen Wu, Deliang Chen', 'title': 'Abrupt shift to hotter and drier climate over inner East Asia beyond the tipping point.', 'predicted_label': '0', 'abstract': 'Unprecedented heatwave-drought concurrences in the past two decades have been reported over inner East Asia.

Consequently, researchers are advocating for preservation networks to be set-up to reinforce coral adaptive potential. However, the main obstacle to this implementation is that studies on coral adaption are usually hard to generalize at the scale of a reef system. Here, we study the relationships between genotype frequencies and environmental characteristics of the sea (seascape genomics), in combination with connectivity analysis, to investigate the adaptive potential of a flagship coral species of the Ryukyu Archipelago (Japan). By associating genotype frequencies with descriptors of historical environmental conditions, we discovered six genomic regions hosting polymorphisms that might promote resistance against heat stress. Remarkably, annotations of genes in these regions were consistent with molecular roles associated with heat responses. Furthermore, we combined information on genetic and spatial distances between reefs to predict connectivity at a regional scale. The combination of these results portrayed the adaptive potential of this population: we were able to identify reefs carrying potential heat stress adapted genotypes and to understand how they disperse to neighbouring reefs. This information was summarized by objective, quantifiable and mappable indices covering the whole region, which can be extremely useful for future prioritization of reefs in conservation planning.

Using an extensive time series of co-located reef fish community structure and habitat data spanning 12 years and the entire Australian continent, we found that reef fish community responses to changing temperatures and habitats are dynamic and widespread but regionally patchy. Shifts in composition and abundance of the fish community often occurred within 2 years of environmental or habitat change, although the relative importance of these two mechanisms of climate impact tended to differ between tropical and temperate zones. The clearest of these changes on temperate and subtropical reefs were temperature related, with responses measured by the reef fish thermal index indicating reshuffling according to the thermal affinities of species present.

The association between heatwaves and elderly mortality is highly researched in developed countries. In contrast, heatwave impact on hospital admissions has been insufficiently studied worldwide due to data availability and sensitivity. In our opinion, the relationship between heatwaves and hospital admissions is worthwhile to explore as it could have a profound impact on healthcare systems. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the associations between heatwaves and hospitalisations for the elderly by age group in Selangor, Malaysia, from 2010 to 2020. We further explored the impact of heatwaves on the risks of cause-specific hospital admissions across age groups within the elderly. This study applied generalized additive models (GAMs) with the Poisson family and distributed lag models (DLMs) to estimate the effect of heatwaves on hospitalisations. According to the findings, there was no significant increase in hospitalisations for those aged 60 and older during heatwaves; however, a rise in mean apparent temperature (ATmean) by 1 °C significantly increased the risk of hospital admission by 12.9%. Heatwaves had no immediate effects on hospital admissions among elderly patients, but significant delay effects were identified for ATmean with a lag of 0-3 days. The hospital admission rates of the elderly groups started declining after a 5-day average following the heatwave event. Females were found to be relatively more vulnerable than males during heatwave periods. Consequently, these results can provide a reference to improve public health strategies to target elderly people who are at the greatest risk of hospitalisations due to heatwaves. Development of early heatwave and health warning systems for the elderly would assist with preventing and reducing health risks while also minimising the burden on the whole hospital system in Selangor, Malaysia.', 'link': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37239636/', 'source': 'pubmed'}, {'id': 208, 'authors': nan, 'title': 'Global burden of chronic respiratory diseases and risk factors, 1990-2019: an update from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.', 'predicted_label': '0', 'abstract': 'Updated data on chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) are vital in their prevention, control, and treatment in the path to achieving the third UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a one-third reduction in premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by 2030.

Heatwaves may affect macroinvertebrates' bioturbating behavior in intertidal areas, thereby altering the deposition-erosion balance at tidal flats. Moreover, small-scale topographic features on tidal flats can create tidal pools during the low tide, thus changing the heat capacity of tidal flats. These pools could then potentially operate as refuge environments during marine heatwaves. We studied behavior responses to heat waves using the well-known bioturbating cockle Cerastoderma edule as a model species. Different temperature regimes (i.e., fluctuating between 20 and 40 °C) and micro-topographies (i.e., presence vs. absence of tidal water pools) were mimicked in a mesocosm experiment with regular tidal regimes. Our results demonstrate that behavioral responses to heat stress strongly depend on the site-specific morphological features. Cockles covered by shallow water pools moved up when exposed to thermal stress, while burrowing deeper into the sediment in the absence of water pools. But in both cases, their migratory behavior increased under heat stress compared to regular ambient treatments. Moreover, long-term cumulative heat stress increased cockles' respiration rates and decreased their health conditions, causing mass mortality after four weeks of gradually increasing heat exposure.

Increased climatic variability is expected to have different effects on species and ecosystems than gradual warming. A key challenge to predict the impact of climate change is to understand how temperature changes will affect species interactions. Herbivorous insects and their natural enemies belong to some of the largest groups of terrestrial animals, and thus they have a great impact on the functioning of ecosystems and on the services these ecosystems provide. Here we studied the life history traits of the plant-feeding insect Plutella xylostella and its specialist endoparasitoid Diadegma semiclausum, when exposed to a daily heat pulse of 5 or 10°C temperature increase during their entire immature phase. Growth and developmental responses differed with the amplitude of the heat pulse and they were different between host and parasitoid, indicating different thermal sensitivity of the two trophic levels. With a +5°C heat pulse, the adult parasitoids were larger which may result in a higher fitness, whereas a +10°C heat pulse retarded parasitoid development. These results show that the parasitoid is more sensitive than its host to brief intervals of temperature change, and this results in either positive or negative effects on life history traits, depending on the amplitude of the heat pulse. These findings suggest that more extreme fluctuations may disrupt host-parasitoid synchrony, whereas moderate fluctuations may improve parasitoid fitness.', 'link': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28453570/', 'source': 'pubmed'}, {'id': 380, 'authors': 'Jianyang Xia, Shuli Niu, Philippe Ciais, Ivan A Janssens, Jiquan Chen, Christof Ammann, Altaf Arain, Peter D Blanken, Alessandro Cescatti, Damien Bonal, Nina Buchmann, Peter S Curtis, Shiping Chen, Jinwei Dong, Lawrence B Flanagan, Christian Frankenberg, Teodoro Georgiadis, Christopher M Gough, Dafeng Hui, Gerard Kiely, Jianwei Li, Magnus Lund, Vincenzo Magliulo, Barbara Marcolla, Lutz Merbold, Leonardo Montagnani, Eddy J Moors, Jørgen E Olesen, Shilong Piao, Antonio Raschi, Olivier Roupsard, Andrew E Suyker, Marek Urbaniak, Francesco P Vaccari, Andrej Varlagin, Timo Vesala, Matthew Wilkinson, Ensheng Weng, Georg Wohlfahrt, Liming Yan, Yiqi Luo', 'title': 'Joint control of terrestrial gross primary productivity by plant phenology and physiology.', 'predicted_label': '0', 'abstract': 'Terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) varies greatly over time and space.

It also explained GPP response to the European heatwave in 2003 (r(2) = 0.90) and GPP recovery after a fire disturbance in South Dakota (r(2) = 0.88). Additional analysis of the eddy-covariance flux data shows that the interbiome variation in annual GPP is better explained by that in GPPmax than CUP. These findings indicate that terrestrial GPP is jointly controlled by ecosystem-level plant phenology and photosynthetic capacity, and greater understanding of GPPmax and CUP responses to environmental and biological variations will, thus, improve predictions of GPP over time and space.', 'link': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25730847/', 'source': 'pubmed'}]"

Over the last 20\xa0years, three major coral bleaching events occurred in concomitance with anomalous heatwaves, provoking a severe loss of coral cover worldwide. The conservation strategies for preserving reefs, as they are implemented now, cannot cope with global climatic shifts. Consequently, researchers are advocating for preservation networks to be set-up to reinforce coral adaptive potential. However, the main obstacle to this implementation is that studies on coral adaption are usually hard to generalize at the scale of a reef system. Here, we study the relationships between genotype frequencies and environmental characteristics of the sea (seascape genomics), in combination with connectivity analysis, to investigate the adaptive potential of a flagship coral species of the Ryukyu Archipelago (Japan). By associating genotype frequencies with descriptors of historical environmental conditions, we discovered six genomic regions hosting polymorphisms that might promote resistance against heat stress. Remarkably, annotations of genes in these regions were consistent with molecular roles associated with heat responses. Furthermore, we combined information on genetic and spatial distances between reefs to predict connectivity at a regional scale. The combination of these results portrayed the adaptive potential of this population: we were able to identify reefs carrying potential heat stress adapted genotypes and to understand how they disperse to neighbouring reefs. This information was summarized by objective, quantifiable and mappable indices covering the whole region, which can be extremely useful for future prioritization of reefs in conservation planning. This framework is transferable to any coral species on any reef system and therefore represents a valuable tool for empowering preservation efforts dedicated to the protection of coral reefs in warming oceans.', 'link': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32908595/', 'source': 'pubmed'}]"

Under all future climate change models, extreme heat events will continue to increase in frequency, duration, and intensity. Evidence from previous extreme heat events across the globe demonstrates that adverse cardiovascular events are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly amongst the elderly and those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. However, less is understood about the adverse effects of extreme heat amongst specific cardiovascular diseases (i.e., heart failure, dysrhythmias) and demographics (sex, ethnicity, age) within Australia and New Zealand. Furthermore, although Australia has implemented regional and state heat warning systems, most personal heat-health protective advice available in public health policy documents is either insufficient, not grounded in scientific evidence, and/or does not consider clinical factors such as age or co-morbidities. Dissemination of evidence-based recommendations and enhancing community resilience to extreme heat disasters within Australia and New Zealand should be an area of critical focus to reduce the burden and negative health effects associated with extreme heat.

Many of these events have yet to be described in terms of their physical attributes, generation mechanisms, or ecological impacts. Our synthesis identifies commonalities between marine heatwave characteristics and seasonality, links to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, triggering processes and impacts on ocean productivity. The most intense events preferentially occur in summer, when climatological oceanic mixed layers are shallow and winds are weak, but at a time preceding climatological maximum sea surface temperatures. Most subtropical extreme marine heatwaves were triggered by persistent atmospheric high-pressure systems and anomalously weak wind speeds, associated with increased insolation, and reduced ocean heat losses. Furthermore, the most extreme events tended to coincide with reduced chlorophyll-a concentration at low and mid-latitudes.

The product of CUP and GPPmax explained >90% of the temporal GPP variability in most areas of North America during 2000-2010 and the spatial GPP variation among globally distributed eddy flux tower sites. It also explained GPP response to the European heatwave in 2003 (r(2) = 0.90) and GPP recovery after a fire disturbance in South Dakota (r(2) = 0.88). Additional analysis of the eddy-covariance flux data shows that the interbiome variation in annual GPP is better explained by that in GPPmax than CUP. These findings indicate that terrestrial GPP is jointly controlled by ecosystem-level plant phenology and photosynthetic capacity, and greater understanding of GPPmax and CUP responses to environmental and biological variations will, thus, improve predictions of GPP over time and space.', 'link': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25730847/', 'source': 'pubmed'}]"

These areas are highly threatened by climate change-related factors as well as pollution, especially due to their limited water exchange. Ocean warming and extreme weather events, such as marine heatwaves and rainy periods, are some of the consequences of climate change, inducing alterations in the abiotic parameters of seawater, namely temperature and salinity, which may affect the organisms as well as the behaviour of some pollutants present in water. Lithium (Li) is an element widely used in several industries, especially in the production of batteries for electronic gadgets and electric vehicles. The demand for its exploitation has been growing drastically and is predicted a large increase in the coming years. Inefficient recycling, treatment and disposal results in the release of Li into the aquatic systems, the consequences of which are poorly understood, especially in the context of climate change. Considering that a limited number of studies exist about the impacts of Li on marine species, the present study aimed to assess the effects of temperature rise and salinity changes on the impacts of Li in clams (Venerupis corrugata) collected from the Ria de Aveiro (coastal lagoon, Portugal). Clams were exposed for 14 days to 0 μg/L of Li and 200\xa0μg/L of Li, both conditions under different climate scenarios: 3 different salinities (20, 30 and 40) at 17\xa0°C (control temperature); and 2 different temperatures (17 and 21\xa0°C) at salinity 30 (control salinity). Bioconcentration capacity and biochemical alterations regarding metabolism and oxidative stress were investigated. Salinity variations had a higher impact on biochemical responses than temperature increase, even when combined with Li. The combination of Li with low salinity (20) was the most stressful treatment, provoking increased metabolism and activation of detoxification defences, suggesting possible imbalances in coastal ecosystems in response to Li pollution under extreme weather events.

The present study aimed to characterize in Mytilus galloprovincialis the influence of a simulated MHW scenario on the toxicological effects of the pharmaceutical carbamazepine (CBZ), ubiquitously detected in the marine environment and chosen as model compound for this relevant class of emerging contaminants. The bioaccumulation of CBZ and responsiveness of various biological parameters, including immune system, antioxidant status, lipid metabolism and cellular integrity, were analyzed in exposed mussels both during and after the end of the heatwave.

An array of human activities impacts these areas leading to multiple-stressor interactions. Temperature and salinity are among the most relevant drivers in estuaries, shaping species growth, reproduction and distribution. However, few studies provide an overview of cellular rewiring processes under multiple-stressor environments. Here, we tested how salinity could shape the response of ragworms Hediste diversicolor, an important bioindicator and commercial species, to elevated temperature. We exposed polychaetes to three temperatures for a month, simulating control, ocean warming and heatwave conditions (24, 27 and 30 °C, respectively) combined with two salinities (20 and 30). We quantified whole-organism performance (wet weight gain and survival), along with cellular stress response (CSR) and energy reserves of worms after 14 and 28 days of exposure. Significant three-way interactions between temperature, salinity and exposure time show the non-linearity of molecular responses. Worms at a salinity of 20 were more sensitive to warming than worms exposed to a salinity of 30. The combination of high temperature and low salinity can act synergistically to induce oxidative stress and macromolecular damage in worm tissues. This finding was supported by an induction of the CSR, with a concomitant decrease of energy reserves, pointing towards a metabolic compensation strategy. However, under a higher salinity (30), the need for a CSR upon thermal challenge was reduced and energy content increased with temperature, which suggests that environmental conditions were within the optimum range. Heatwaves striking low-salinity areas of estuaries can therefore negatively impact the cellular physiology of H. diversicolor, with greater metabolic costs. However, extreme stress levels were not reached as worms incremented wet weight and survival was high under all conditions tested.

The level of heatwave warning is normally determined by using the threshold temperature of heat-related morbidity or mortality.

In this study, we developed a heatwave warning system with two different warning levels: Level-1 and Level-2, by analyzing the severity and likelihood of heat-related morbidity and mortality using the generalized additive model. The study particularly focuses on the cases in Seoul, South Korea, between 2011 and 2018. The study found that the threshold temperature for heat-related morbidity and mortality are 30 °C and 33 °C, respectively. Approximately 73.1% of heat-related patients visited hospitals when temperature was between 30 °C and 33 °C. We validated the developed HWWS by using both the threshold temperatures of morbidity and mortality. The area under curves (AUCs) of the proposed model were 0.74 and 0.86 at Level-1 and Level-2, respectively.

These health effects are related to not only the physical phenomenon of heat itself but other characteristics such as frequency, intensity, and duration of heatwaves. Therefore, understanding heatwave characteristics is a crucial step in the development of heat-health warning systems (HHWS) that could prevent or reduce negative heat-related health outcomes. However, there are no South African studies that have quantified heatwaves with a threshold that incorporated a temperature metric based on a health outcome. To fill this gap, this study aimed to assess the spatial and temporal distribution and frequency of past (2014 - 2019) and future (period 2020 - 2039) heatwaves across South Africa. Heatwaves were defined using a threshold for diurnal temperature range (DTR) that was found to have measurable impacts on mortality. In the current climate, inland provinces experienced fewer heatwaves of longer duration and greater intensity compared to coastal provinces that experienced heatwaves of lower intensity. The highest frequency of heatwaves occurred during the austral summer accounting for a total of 150 events out of 270 from 2014 to 2019. The heatwave definition applied in this study also identified severe heatwaves across the country during late 2015 to early 2016 which was during the strongest El Niño event ever recorded to date. Record-breaking global temperatures were reported during this period; the North West province in South Africa was the worst affected experiencing heatwaves ranging from 12 to 77\xa0days. Future climate analysis showed increasing trends in heatwave events with the greatest increases (80%-87%) expected to occur during summer months. The number of heatwaves occurring in cooler seasons is expected to increase with more events projected from the winter months of July and August, onwards. The findings of this study show that the identification of provinces and towns that experience intense, long-lasting heatwaves is crucial to inform development and implementation of targeted heat-health adaptation strategies.

We find that in extended summer months, the MHWs at tropical and subtropical reefs (divided at ~20°S) are driven by opposite ENSO polarities: MHWs are more likely to occur at the tropical reefs during eastern Pacific El Niño, driven by enhanced solar radiation and weaker Australian Monsoon, some likely alleviated by positive Indian Ocean Dipole events, and at the subtropical reefs during central Pacific La Niña, mainly caused by increased horizontal heat transport, and in some cases reinforced by local air-sea interactions.

Most subtropical extreme marine heatwaves were triggered by persistent atmospheric high-pressure systems and anomalously weak wind speeds, associated with increased insolation, and reduced ocean heat losses.

We applied distributed lag non-linear models in an individual-level case-crossover design to assess the effects of heat on mortality in Switzerland during the warm season from 2003 to 2016 for three temperature metrics (daily mean, maximum, and minimum temperature), and various threshold temperatures and heatwave definitions. Individual death records with information on residential address from the Swiss National Cohort were linked to high-resolution temperature estimates from 100 m resolution maps. Moderate (90th percentile) to extreme thresholds (99.5th percentile) of the three temperature metrics implied a significant increase in mortality (5 to 38%) in respect of the median warm-season temperature. Effects of the threshold temperatures on mortality were similar across the seven major regions in Switzerland. Heatwave duration did not modify the effect when considering delayed effects up to 7 days.

Over the last 20\xa0years, three major coral bleaching events occurred in concomitance with anomalous heatwaves, provoking a severe loss of coral cover worldwide. The conservation strategies for preserving reefs, as they are implemented now, cannot cope with global climatic shifts. Consequently, researchers are advocating for preservation networks to be set-up to reinforce coral adaptive potential. However, the main obstacle to this implementation is that studies on coral adaption are usually hard to generalize at the scale of a reef system. Here, we study the relationships between genotype frequencies and environmental characteristics of the sea (seascape genomics), in combination with connectivity analysis, to investigate the adaptive potential of a flagship coral species of the Ryukyu Archipelago (Japan). By associating genotype frequencies with descriptors of historical environmental conditions, we discovered six genomic regions hosting polymorphisms that might promote resistance against heat stress. Remarkably, annotations of genes in these regions were consistent with molecular roles associated with heat responses. Furthermore, we combined information on genetic and spatial distances between reefs to predict connectivity at a regional scale. The combination of these results portrayed the adaptive potential of this population: we were able to identify reefs carrying potential heat stress adapted genotypes and to understand how they disperse to neighbouring reefs. This information was summarized by objective, quantifiable and mappable indices covering the whole region, which can be extremely useful for future prioritization of reefs in conservation planning.

Flux measurements showed that at lower elevation sites (below 1000 m.a.s.l.; grassland and mixed forest) annual ecosystem productivity (GPP) declined by approximately 20% compared to the previous 2 years (2016 and 2017), which led to a reduced annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP). At the high elevation sites, however, GPP increased by approximately 14% and as a result NEP increased in the alpine and montane grasslands, but not in the subalpine coniferous forest. There, increased ecosystem respiration led to a reduced annual NEP, despite increased GPP and lengthening of the growing period. Among all ecosystems, the coniferous forest showed the most pronounced negative stomatal response to atmospheric dryness (i.e. vapour pressure deficit, VPD) that resulted in a decline in surface conductance and an increased water-use efficiency during drought. While increased temperature enhanced the water-use efficiency of both forests, de-coupling of GPP from evapotranspiration at the low-elevation grassland site negatively affected water-use efficiency due to non-stomatal reductions in photosynthesis. Our results show that hot droughts (such as in 2018) lead to different responses across plants types, and thus ecosystems.

Owing to the growing concern of rising temperatures, we analyzed the potential response in a number of river sections that are subject to hydropeaking and thermopeaking through the intermittent release of water from hydropower stations. Thermopeaking in alpine streams is known to intermittently cool down the river water in summer and to warm it up in winter. We analyzed the response of river water temperature to air temperature during heatwaves at 19 gauging stations across Switzerland, using a 30-yr dataset at a 10-min resolution. Stations were either classified into ""unpeaked"" or ""peaked"" groups according to four statistical indicators related to hydropeaking and thermopeaking pressure. Peaked stations were exposed to reduced temporal variability in river water temperature, and it was determined that correlations between river water and air temperature were weaker for peaked stations compared with unpeaked stations. Similarly, peaked stations showed a much weaker response to heatwaves compared with unpeaked stations. It is important to note that this ""cooling effect"" created by hydro-thermopeaking was most pronounced during the two major heatwave events that took place in 2003 and 2006. Furthermore, results from thermal stress events on the growth of a typical cold eurythermic fish species (brown trout) increased continuously in rivers subject to peaked station water release during heatwaves.

A better understanding of this variability is necessary for more accurate predictions of the future climate-carbon cycle feedback. Recent studies have suggested that variability in GPP is driven by a broad range of biotic and abiotic factors operating mainly through changes in vegetation phenology and physiological processes. However, it is still unclear how plant phenology and physiology can be integrated to explain the spatiotemporal variability of terrestrial GPP. Based on analyses of eddy-covariance and satellite-derived data, we decomposed annual terrestrial GPP into the length of the CO2 uptake period (CUP) and the seasonal maximal capacity of CO2 uptake (GPPmax). The product of CUP and GPPmax explained >90% of the temporal GPP variability in most areas of North America during 2000-2010 and the spatial GPP variation among globally distributed eddy flux tower sites. It also explained GPP response to the European heatwave in 2003 (r(2) = 0.90) and GPP recovery after a fire disturbance in South Dakota (r(2) = 0.88). Additional analysis of the eddy-covariance flux data shows that the interbiome variation in annual GPP is better explained by that in GPPmax than CUP. These findings indicate that terrestrial GPP is jointly controlled by ecosystem-level plant phenology and photosynthetic capacity, and greater understanding of GPPmax and CUP responses to environmental and biological variations will, thus, improve predictions of GPP over time and space.', 'link': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25730847/', 'source': 'pubmed'}]"

Timely management of rapidly changing marine ecosystems must be matched with methods to rapidly quantify and assess climate driven impacts to ecological communities. Here we create a species-specific, classification system for fish thermal affinities, using three quantifiable datasets and expert opinion. Multiple sources of information limit potential data bias and avoid misclassification. Using a temperate kelp forest fish community in California, USA as a test case for this new methodology, we found the majority of species had high classification agreement across all four data sources (n = 78) but also a number of low agreement species (2 sources disagree from the others, n = 47). For species with low agreement, use of just one dataset to classify species, as is commonly done, would lead to high risk of misclassification. Differences in species classification between individual datasets and our composite classification were apparent. Applying different thermal classifications, lead to different conclusions when quantifying 'warm' and 'cool' species density responses to a marine heatwave. Managers can use this classification approach as a tool to generate accurate, timely and simple information for resource management."", 'link': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33909693/', 'source': 'pubmed'}, {'id': 51, 'authors': 'Alyse A Larkin, Allison R Moreno, Adam J Fagan, Alyssa Fowlds, Alani Ruiz, Adam C Martiny', 'title': 'Persistent El Niño driven shifts in marine cyanobacteria populations.', 'predicted_label': '0', 'abstract': 'In the California Current Ecosystem, El Niño acts as a natural phenomenon that is partially representative of climate change impacts on marine bacteria at timescales relevant to microbial communities. Between 2014-2016, the North Pacific warm anomaly (a.k.a., the ""blob"") and an El Niño event resulted in prolonged ocean warming in the Southern California Bight (SCB). To determine whether this ""marine heatwave"" resulted in shifts in microbial populations, we sequenced the rpoC1 gene from the biogeochemically important picocyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus at 434 time points from 2009-2018 in the MICRO time series at Newport Beach, CA. Across the time series, we observed an increase in the abundance of Prochlorococcus relative to Synechococcus as well as elevated frequencies of ecotypes commonly associated with low-nutrient and high-temperature conditions. The relationships between environmental and ecotype trends appeared to operate on differing temporal scales. In contrast to ecotype trends, most microdiverse populations were static and possibly reflect local habitat conditions. The only exceptions were microdiversity from Prochlorococcous HLI and Synechococcus Clade II that shifted in response to the 2015 El Niño event. Overall, Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus populations did not return to their pre-heatwave composition by the end of this study. This research demonstrates that extended warming in the SCB can result in persistent changes in key microbial populations.', 'link': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32936809/', 'source': 'pubmed'}, {'id': 52, 'authors': 'John F Piatt, Julia K Parrish, Heather M Renner, Sarah K Schoen, Timothy T Jones, Mayumi L Arimitsu, Kathy J Kuletz, Barbara Bodenstein, Marisol García-Reyes, Rebecca S Duerr, Robin M Corcoran, Robb S A Kaler, Gerard J McChesney, Richard T Golightly, Heather A Coletti, Robert M Suryan, Hillary K Burgess, Jackie Lindsey, Kirsten Lindquist, Peter M Warzybok, Jaime Jahncke, Jan Roletto, William J Sydeman', 'title': 'Extreme mortality and reproductive failure of common murres resulting from the northeast Pacific marine heatwave of 2014-2016.', 'predicted_label': '0', 'abstract': 'About 62,000 dead or dying common murres (Uria aalge), the trophically dominant fish-eating seabird of the North Pacific, washed ashore between summer 2015 and spring 2016 on beaches from California to Alaska. Most birds were severely emaciated and, so far, no evidence for anything other than starvation was found to explain this mass mortality. Three-quarters of murres were found in the Gulf of Alaska and the remainder along the West Coast. Studies show that only a fraction of birds that die at sea typically wash ashore, and we estimate that total mortality approached 1 million birds. About two-thirds of murres killed were adults, a substantial blow to breeding populations. Additionally, 22 complete reproductive failures were observed at multiple colonies region-wide during (2015) and after (2016-2017) the mass mortality event. Die-offs and breeding failures occur sporadically in murres, but the magnitude, duration and spatial extent of this die-off, associated with multi-colony and multi-year reproductive failures, is unprecedented and astonishing. These events co-occurred with the most powerful marine heatwave on record that persisted through 2014-2016 and created an enormous volume of ocean water (the ""Blob"") from California to Alaska with temperatures that exceeded average by 2-3 standard deviations. Other studies indicate that this prolonged heatwave reduced phytoplankton biomass and restructured zooplankton communities in favor of lower-calorie species, while it simultaneously increased metabolically driven food demands of ectothermic forage fish. In response, forage fish quality and quantity diminished. Similarly, large ectothermic groundfish were thought to have increased their demand for forage fish, resulting in greater top-predator demands for diminished forage fish resources. We hypothesize that these bottom-up and top-down forces created an ""ectothermic vise"" on forage species leading to their system-wide scarcity and resulting in mass mortality of murres and many other fish, bird and mammal species in the region during 2014-2017.', 'link': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31940310/', 'source': 'pubmed'}, {'id': 509, 'authors': nan, 'title': nan, 'predicted_label': 0, 'abstract': nan, 'link': 'https://toolkit.climate.gov/case-studies/developing-early-warning-system-prevent-heat-illness&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwim9dau0NSBAxV4r5UCHWdHBvgQFnoECAYQAg&amp;usg=AOvVaw2mL_h9Q4FYWJGPB-l2LEL2""', 'source': 'google_scholar'}]"
