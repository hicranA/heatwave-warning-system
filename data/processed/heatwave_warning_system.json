The association between heatwaves and elderly mortality is highly researched in developed countries. In contrast, heatwave impact on hospital admissions has been insufficiently studied worldwide due to data availability and sensitivity. In our opinion, the relationship between heatwaves and hospital admissions is worthwhile to explore as it could have a profound impact on healthcare systems. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the associations between heatwaves and hospitalisations for the elderly by age group in Selangor, Malaysia, from 2010 to 2020. We further explored the impact of heatwaves on the risks of cause-specific hospital admissions across age groups within the elderly. This study applied generalized additive models (GAMs) with the Poisson family and distributed lag models (DLMs) to estimate the effect of heatwaves on hospitalisations. According to the findings, there was no significant increase in hospitalisations for those aged 60 and older during heatwaves; however, a rise in mean apparent temperature (ATmean) by 1 \u00b0C significantly increased the risk of hospital admission by 12.9%. Heatwaves had no immediate effects on hospital admissions among elderly patients, but significant delay effects were identified for ATmean with a lag of 0-3 days. The hospital admission rates of the elderly groups started declining after a 5-day average following the heatwave event. Females were found to be relatively more vulnerable than males during heatwave periods. Consequently, these results can provide a reference to improve public health strategies to target elderly people who are at the greatest risk of hospitalisations due to heatwaves. Development of early heatwave and health warning systems for the elderly would assist with preventing and reducing health risks while also minimising the burden on the whole hospital system in Selangor, Malaysia.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/37239636\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":239,"authors":null,"title":"Global burden of chronic respiratory diseases and risk factors, 1990-2019: an update from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Updated data on chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) are vital in their prevention, control, and treatment in the path to achieving the third UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a one-third reduction in premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by 2030.

There is growing evidence that this rapid warming of coastal waters is increasing the abundance and virulence of pathogenic members of the Vibrionaceae, posing a significant health risk to both humans and aquatic organisms. Fish disease, notably outbreaks of emerging pathogens in response to environmental perturbations such as heatwaves, have been recognised in aquaculture settings. Considerably less is known about how rising sea surface temperatures will impact the microbiology of wild fish populations, particularly those within estuarine systems that are more vulnerable to warming. We used a combination of Vibrio-specific quantitative PCR and amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA and hsp60 genes to examine seawater and fish (Pelates sexlineatus) gut microbial communities across a quasi-natural experimental system, where thermal pollution from coal-fired power stations creates a temperature gradient of up to 6\u00a0\u00b0C, compatible with future predicted temperature increases. At the warmest site, fish hindgut microbial communities were in a state of dysbiosis characterised by shifts in beta diversity and a proliferation (71.5% relative abundance) of the potential fish pathogen Photobacterium damselae subsp. damselae. Comparable patterns were not identified in the surrounding seawater, indicating opportunistic proliferation within estuarine fish guts under thermal stress. A subsequent evaluation of predicted future warming-related risk due to pathogenic Vibrionaceae in temperate estuarine fish demonstrated that warming is likely to drive opportunistic pathogen increases in the upper latitudinal range of this estuarine fish, potentially impacting adaptations to future warming. These findings represent a breakthrough in our understanding of the dynamics of emerging pathogens in populations of wild aquatic organisms within environments likely to experience rapid warming under future climate change.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/36584839\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":242,"authors":"Georgia K Chaseling, Nathan B Morris, Nicholas Ravanelli","title":"Extreme Heat and Adverse Cardiovascular Outcomes in Australia and New Zealand: What Do We Know?","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Extreme heat events are a leading natural hazard risk to human health.

However, less is understood about the adverse effects of extreme heat amongst specific cardiovascular diseases (i.e., heart failure, dysrhythmias) and demographics (sex, ethnicity, age) within Australia and New Zealand.

Using an extensive time series of co-located reef fish community structure and habitat data spanning 12 years and the entire Australian continent, we found that reef fish community responses to changing temperatures and habitats are dynamic and widespread but regionally patchy. Shifts in composition and abundance of the fish community often occurred within 2 years of environmental or habitat change, although the relative importance of these two mechanisms of climate impact tended to differ between tropical and temperate zones. The clearest of these changes on temperate and subtropical reefs were temperature related, with responses measured by the reef fish thermal index indicating reshuffling according to the thermal affinities of species present. On low latitude coral reefs, the community generalization index indicated shifting dominance of habitat generalist fishes through time, concurrent with changing coral cover. Our results emphasize the importance of maintaining local ecological detail when scaling up datasets to inform national policies and global biodiversity targets.

Children are particularly vulnerable to GCC due to developing organ systems, psychological immaturity, nature of daily activities, and higher level of per-body-unit exposure. There is a rising trend in the disease burden of childhood asthma and allergies in many parts of the world. The associations of CC, air pollution and other environmental exposures with childhood asthma are attracting more research attention, but relatively few studies have focused on CC adaptation measures and childhood asthma. This study aimed to bridge this knowledge gap and conducted the first systematic review on CC adaptation measures and childhood asthma. We searched electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science using a set of MeSH terms and related synonyms, and identified 20 eligible studies included for review. We found that there were a number of adaptation measures proposed for childhood asthma in response to GCC, including vulnerability assessment, improving ventilation and heating, enhancing community education, and developing forecast models and early warning systems. Several randomized controlled trials show that improving ventilation and installing heating in the homes appear to be an effective way to relieve childhood asthma symptoms, especially in winter. However, the effectiveness of most adaptation measures, except for improving ventilation and heating, have not been explored and quantified. Given more extreme weather events (e.g., cold spells and heatwaves) may occur as climate change progresses, this finding may have important implications. Evidently, further research is urgently warranted to evaluate the impacts of CC adaptation measures on childhood asthma. These adaptation measures, if proven to be effective, should be integrated in childhood asthma control and prevention programs as GCC continues.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/35644404\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":245,"authors":"Stanley Kin Nok Chan, Sneha Suresh, Phillip Munday, Timothy Ravasi, Mois\u00e9s A Bernal, Celia Schunter","title":"The alternative splicing landscape of a coral reef fish during a marine heatwave.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Alternative splicing is a molecular mechanism that enables a single gene to encode multiple transcripts and proteins by post-transcriptional modification of pre-RNA molecules.

BVOCs are emitted by plants in a rapid protective response to abiotic stress, mediated by the energetic status of leaves (the excess of reducing power when photosynthetic light and dark reactions are decoupled, as occurs when stomata close in response to water stress). Emissions also increase exponentially with leaf temperature. New analytical methods for the detection of spatiotemporally contiguous extremes in remote-sensing data are applied here to satellite-derived atmospheric HCHO columns. BVOC emissions are shown to play a central role in the formation of the largest positive HCHO anomalies.

Imposing experimental water deficits is key to gaining this understanding, but has been hindered by logistic difficulties in maintaining consistently low water availability for plants. Here, we describe a simple method for applying soil water deficits to potted plants in glasshouse experiments. We modified an existing method (the \"Snow and Tingey system\") in order to apply a gradual, moderate water deficit to 50 plant species of different life forms (grasses, vines, shrubs, trees). The method requires less maintenance and manual handling compared to other water deficit methods, so it can be used for extended periods of time and is relatively inexpensive to implement. With only a few modifications, it is possible to easily establish and maintain soil water deficits of differing intensity and duration, as well as to incorporate interacting stress factors. We tested this method by measuring physiological responses to an applied water deficit in a subset of 11 tree\/shrub species with a wide range of drought tolerances and water-use strategies. For this subgroup of species, stomatal conductance was 2-17 times lower in droughted plants than controls, although only half of the species (5 out of 11) experienced midday leaf water potentials that exceeded their turgor loss (i.e., wilting) point. Leaf temperatures were up to 8\u00b0C higher in droughted plants than controls, indicating that droughted plants are at greater risk of thermal damage, relative to unstressed plants. The largest leaf temperature differences (between droughted and well-watered plants) were in species with high rates of water loss. Rapid osmotic adjustment was observed in leaves of five species when drought stress was combined with an experimental heatwave. These results highlight the potential value of further ecological and physiological experiments utilizing this simple water deficit method to study plant responses to drought stress.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/32038685\/","source":"pubmed"}],"Heatwaves Warning Systems other sources":"No"}

One such condition, heat stress, contributes massively to crop losses globally. Heatwaves are predicted to increase, and it is of vital importance to generate crops that are tolerant to not only heat stress but also to several other abiotic stresses (e.g. drought stress, salinity stress) to ensure that global food security is protected. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the temperature stress response in pollen will be a significant step towards developing effective breeding strategies for high and stable production in crop plants. While most studies have focused on the vegetative phase of plant growth to understand heat stress tolerance, it is the reproductive phase that requires more attention as it is more sensitive to elevated temperatures. Every phase of reproductive development is affected by environmental challenges, including pollen and ovule development, pollen tube growth, male-female cross-talk, fertilization, and embryo development. In this review we summarize how pollen is affected by heat stress and the molecular mechanisms employed during the stress period, as revealed by classical and -omics experiments.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/33818773\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":141,"authors":"Elisabeth Anne-Sophie Mayrhuber, Michel L A D\u00fcckers, Peter Wallner, Arne Arnberger, Brigitte Allex, Laura Wiesb\u00f6ck, Anna Wanka, Franz Kolland, Renate Eder, Hans-Peter Hutter, Ruth Kutalek","title":"Vulnerability to heatwaves and implications for public health interventions - A scoping review.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Heatwaves form a serious public health threat, especially for vulnerable groups.

Variability in formaldehyde (HCHO) concentrations in the troposphere is dominated by local emissions of short-lived biogenic (BVOC) and pyrogenic volatile organic compounds. BVOCs are emitted by plants in a rapid protective response to abiotic stress, mediated by the energetic status of leaves (the excess of reducing power when photosynthetic light and dark reactions are decoupled, as occurs when stomata close in response to water stress). Emissions also increase exponentially with leaf temperature. New analytical methods for the detection of spatiotemporally contiguous extremes in remote-sensing data are applied here to satellite-derived atmospheric HCHO columns. BVOC emissions are shown to play a central role in the formation of the largest positive HCHO anomalies. Although vegetation stress can be captured by various remotely sensed quantities, spaceborne HCHO emerges as the most consistent recorder of vegetation responses to the largest climate extremes, especially in forested regions.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/34510653\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":368,"authors":"Kirsten Vanderplanken, Peter van den Hazel, Michael Marx, Ahmad Zia Shams, Debarati Guha-Sapir, Joris Adriaan Frank van Loenhout","title":"Governing heatwaves in Europe: comparing health policy and practices to better understand roles, responsibilities and collaboration.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"The expectation that climate change will further exacerbate extreme weather events such as heatwaves is of primary concern to policymakers and scientists.

Moreover, phase shifts in this region have mostly been characterized by the emergence of algae and, less typically, zoantharians. However, nutrient excess and organic pollution are key drivers of the hard coral habitat degradation and may, thus, favor the emergence of novel zoantharian-dominated habitats. Many zoantharian species, particularly those from the genera Palythoa and Zoanthus, have traits that could help them thrive under conditions detrimental to reef-building corals, including rapid growth, several asexual reproduction strategies, high morphological plasticity, and generalist nutrient acquisition strategies. Thus, in a near future, stress-tolerant zoantharians may thrive in nutrient-enriched subtidal SWA locations under low heat stress, such as, upwelling. Overall, coral-zoantharian phase shifts in the SWA may decrease the species richness of reef communities, ultimately influencing ecosystem functioning and services, such as the provision of nursery habitats, fish biomass production, and coastline protection. However, zoantharians will also be threatened at intertidal zones, which are expected to experience higher heat stress, solar radiation, and sea-level rise. Although zoantharians appear to cope well with some local stressors (e.g., decreasing water quality), they are vulnerable to climate change (e.g., heatwaves), invasive species (Tubastraea spp.), microplastics, diseases, and mostly restricted to a narrow depth range (0-15\u00a0m depth) in SWA reefs. This shallow zone is particularly affected by climate change, compressing the three-dimensional habitat and limiting depth refugia in deeper SWA reefs. As mesophotic ecosystems have been hypothesized as short-term refuges to disturbances for some species, the narrow depth limit of zoantharians seems to be a potential factor that might increase their vulnerability to growing climate change pressures in SWA shallow-water reefs. Together, these could lead to both range expansions in some locations and loss of suitable reef habitats in other sites. Additional research is needed to better understand the systemic responses of these novel SWA reefs to the concert of increasing and interactive local and global stressors, and their implications for ecosystem functioning and service provisions.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/34879290\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":14,"authors":"Alex Sen Gupta, Mads Thomsen, Jessica A Benthuysen, Alistair J Hobday, Eric Oliver, Lisa V Alexander, Michael T Burrows, Markus G Donat, Ming Feng, Neil J Holbrook, Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, Pippa J Moore, Regina R Rodrigues, Hillary A Scannell, Andr\u00e9a S Taschetto, Caroline C Ummenhofer, Thomas Wernberg, Dan A Smale","title":"Drivers and impacts of the most extreme marine heatwaves events.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Prolonged high-temperature extreme events in the ocean, marine heatwaves, can have severe and long-lasting impacts on marine ecosystems, fisheries and associated services.

Many of these events have yet to be described in terms of their physical attributes, generation mechanisms, or ecological impacts. Our synthesis identifies commonalities between marine heatwave characteristics and seasonality, links to the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, triggering processes and impacts on ocean productivity. The most intense events preferentially occur in summer, when climatological oceanic mixed layers are shallow and winds are weak, but at a time preceding climatological maximum sea surface temperatures. Most subtropical extreme marine heatwaves were triggered by persistent atmospheric high-pressure systems and anomalously weak wind speeds, associated with increased insolation, and reduced ocean heat losses. Furthermore, the most extreme events tended to coincide with reduced chlorophyll-a concentration at low and mid-latitudes.

However, less is understood about the adverse effects of extreme heat amongst specific cardiovascular diseases (i.e., heart failure, dysrhythmias) and demographics (sex, ethnicity, age) within Australia and New Zealand.

Insufficient systematic broadscale monitoring limits our understanding of the true extent of these impacts and our capacity to track these at scales relevant to national policies and international agreements. Using an extensive time series of co-located reef fish community structure and habitat data spanning 12 years and the entire Australian continent, we found that reef fish community responses to changing temperatures and habitats are dynamic and widespread but regionally patchy. Shifts in composition and abundance of the fish community often occurred within 2 years of environmental or habitat change, although the relative importance of these two mechanisms of climate impact tended to differ between tropical and temperate zones. The clearest of these changes on temperate and subtropical reefs were temperature related, with responses measured by the reef fish thermal index indicating reshuffling according to the thermal affinities of species present. On low latitude coral reefs, the community generalization index indicated shifting dominance of habitat generalist fishes through time, concurrent with changing coral cover.

Health peaks represent a heavy burden for the public health system; they are, however, usually studied specifically when they occur (e.g., the European 2003 heatwave). Specific analyses are needed, using appropriate statistical tools. Quantile regression can provide such analysis by focusing not only on the conditional median, but on different conditional quantiles of the dependent variable.

In this study, quantile regression is used to model the relationships between conditional quantiles of cardiovascular variables and meteorological variables in Montreal (Canada), focusing on health peaks. Results show that meteorological impacts are not constant throughout the conditional quantiles. They are stronger in health peaks compared to quantiles around the median.

An array of human activities impacts these areas leading to multiple-stressor interactions. Temperature and salinity are among the most relevant drivers in estuaries, shaping species growth, reproduction and distribution. However, few studies provide an overview of cellular rewiring processes under multiple-stressor environments. Here, we tested how salinity could shape the response of ragworms Hediste diversicolor, an important bioindicator and commercial species, to elevated temperature. We exposed polychaetes to three temperatures for a month, simulating control, ocean warming and heatwave conditions (24, 27 and 30 \u00b0C, respectively) combined with two salinities (20 and 30). We quantified whole-organism performance (wet weight gain and survival), along with cellular stress response (CSR) and energy reserves of worms after 14 and 28 days of exposure. Significant three-way interactions between temperature, salinity and exposure time show the non-linearity of molecular responses. Worms at a salinity of 20 were more sensitive to warming than worms exposed to a salinity of 30. The combination of high temperature and low salinity can act synergistically to induce oxidative stress and macromolecular damage in worm tissues. This finding was supported by an induction of the CSR, with a concomitant decrease of energy reserves, pointing towards a metabolic compensation strategy. However, under a higher salinity (30), the need for a CSR upon thermal challenge was reduced and energy content increased with temperature, which suggests that environmental conditions were within the optimum range. Heatwaves striking low-salinity areas of estuaries can therefore negatively impact the cellular physiology of H. diversicolor, with greater metabolic costs. However, extreme stress levels were not reached as worms incremented wet weight and survival was high under all conditions tested. Our findings are important for the optimization of ragworm aquaculture and adaptive conservation strategies of estuarine systems.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/34246144\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":93,"authors":"Hassan Anjileli, Laurie S Huning, Hamed Moftakhari, Samaneh Ashraf, Ata Akbari Asanjan, Hamid Norouzi, Amir AghaKouchak","title":"Extreme heat events heighten soil respiration.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"In the wake of climate change, extreme events such as heatwaves are considered to be key players in the terrestrial biosphere.

Although soil respiration (Rs) is the second largest contributor to the carbon cycle, the impacts of heatwaves on Rs have not been fully understood. Using a unique set of continuous high frequency in-situ measurements from our field site, we characterize the relationship between Rs and heatwaves. We further compare the Rs response to heatwaves across ten additional sites spanning the contiguous United States (CONUS). Applying a probabilistic framework, we conclude that during heatwaves Rs rates increase significantly, on average, by ~\u200926% relative to that of non-heatwave conditions over the CONUS. Since previous in-situ observations have not measured the Rs response to heatwaves (e.g., rate, amount) at the high frequency that we present here, the terrestrial feedback to the carbon cycle may be underestimated without capturing these high frequency extreme heatwave events.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/33758210\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":94,"authors":"Mayumi L Arimitsu, John F Piatt, Scott Hatch, Robert M Suryan, Sonia Batten, Mary Anne Bishop, Rob W Campbell, Heather Coletti, Dan Cushing, Kristen Gorman, Russell R Hopcroft, Kathy J Kuletz, Caitlin Marsteller, Caitlin McKinstry, David McGowan, John Moran, Scott Pegau, Anne Schaefer, Sarah Schoen, Jan Straley, Vanessa R von Biela","title":"Heatwave-induced synchrony within forage fish portfolio disrupts energy flow to top pelagic predators.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"During the Pacific marine heatwave of 2014-2016, abundance and quality of several key forage fish species in the Gulf of Alaska were simultaneously reduced throughout the system. Capelin (Mallotus catervarius), sand lance (Ammodytes personatus), and herring (Clupea pallasii) populations were at historically low levels, and within this community abrupt declines in portfolio effects identify trophic instability at the onset of the heatwave. Although compensatory changes in age structure, size, growth or energy content of forage fish were observed to varying degrees among all these forage fish, none were able to fully mitigate adverse impacts of the heatwave, which likely included both top-down and bottom-up forcing. Notably, changes to the demographic structure of forage fish suggested size-selective removals typical of top-down regulation. At the same time, changes in zooplankton communities may have driven bottom-up regulation as copepod community structure shifted toward smaller, warm water species, and euphausiid biomass was reduced owing to the loss of cold-water species. Mediated by these impacts on the forage fish community, an unprecedented disruption of the normal pelagic food web was signaled by higher trophic level disruptions during 2015-2016, when seabirds, marine mammals, and groundfish experienced shifts in distribution, mass mortalities, and reproductive failures. Unlike decadal-scale variability underlying ecosystem regime shifts, the heatwave appeared to temporarily overwhelm the ability of the forage fish community to buffer against changes imposed by warm water anomalies, thereby eliminating any ecological advantages that may have accrued from having a suite of coexisting forage species with differing life-history compensations.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/33577102\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":95,"authors":"Alex Sen Gupta, Mads Thomsen, Jessica A Benthuysen, Alistair J Hobday, Eric Oliver, Lisa V Alexander, Michael T Burrows, Markus G Donat, Ming Feng, Neil J Holbrook, Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, Pippa J Moore, Regina R Rodrigues, Hillary A Scannell, Andr\u00e9a S Taschetto, Caroline C Ummenhofer, Thomas Wernberg, Dan A Smale","title":"Drivers and impacts of the most extreme marine heatwaves events.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Prolonged high-temperature extreme events in the ocean, marine heatwaves, can have severe and long-lasting impacts on marine ecosystems, fisheries and associated services.

However, it is still unclear how plant phenology and physiology can be integrated to explain the spatiotemporal variability of terrestrial GPP. Based on analyses of eddy-covariance and satellite-derived data, we decomposed annual terrestrial GPP into the length of the CO2 uptake period (CUP) and the seasonal maximal capacity of CO2 uptake (GPPmax). The product of CUP and GPPmax explained >90% of the temporal GPP variability in most areas of North America during 2000-2010 and the spatial GPP variation among globally distributed eddy flux tower sites. It also explained GPP response to the European heatwave in 2003 (r(2) = 0.90) and GPP recovery after a fire disturbance in South Dakota (r(2) = 0.88). Additional analysis of the eddy-covariance flux data shows that the interbiome variation in annual GPP is better explained by that in GPPmax than CUP. These findings indicate that terrestrial GPP is jointly controlled by ecosystem-level plant phenology and photosynthetic capacity, and greater understanding of GPPmax and CUP responses to environmental and biological variations will, thus, improve predictions of GPP over time and space.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/25730847\/","source":"pubmed"}],"Heatwaves Warning Systems other sources":"No"}

Herein, we examined the behavioral mechanisms by which heat regulates multiple predator effects in different foraging systems that include Asian paddle crabs (Charybdis japonica) and swimming crabs (Portunus trituberculatus) by quantifying their predation and competition at two temperatures. Our results show that non-independent multiple predator effects occurred in the conspecific treatment of Asian paddle crabs and in the interspecific treatment, whereas independent multiple predator effects occurred in the conspecific treatment of swimming crabs. Asymmetrical behavior responses of these crabs to competition and heat triggered divergences in multiple predator effects. High temperatures increased the strength of multiple predator effects but did not alter their types. The reason is that heat negatively impacts predation by enhancing aggressive interactions, outweighing its direct positive effects on predation.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/36746037\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":302,"authors":"Shengpeng Wang, Zhao Jing, Lixin Wu, Shantong Sun, Qihua Peng, Hong Wang, Yu Zhang, Jian Shi","title":"Southern hemisphere eastern boundary upwelling systems emerging as future marine heatwave hotspots under greenhouse warming.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Marine heatwaves (MHWs) exert devastating impacts on ecosystems and have been revealed to increase in their incidence, duration, and intensity in response to greenhouse warming. The biologically productive eastern boundary upwelling systems (EBUSs) are generally regarded as thermal refugia for marine species due to buffering effects of upwelling on ocean warming. However, using an ensemble of state-of-the-art high-resolution global climate simulations under a high carbon emission scenario, here we show that the MHW stress, measured as the annual cumulative intensity of MHWs, is projected to increase faster in the Southern Hemisphere EBUSs (Humboldt and Benguela current systems) than in their adjacent oceans. This is mainly because the additional warming caused by the weakened eastern boundary currents overwhelms the buffering effect of upwelling.

Here, we assessed impacts of two scenarios of MHWs (low-intensity with 4\u00a0\u00b0C rise of seawater temperature and high-intensity with 8\u00a0\u00b0C rise, respectively) on the byssal production of A. senhousia. Mussels exposed to low-intensity MHWs did not show any significant differences in the number, length and diameter of byssal threads, compared with those not thermally stressed. Under high-intensity scenario, the byssus production was significantly depressed, and byssal threads became fewer, shorter and finer, in line with significant decreases in cumulative length and volume. These findings provide a better understanding of responses of invasive fouling mussels such as A. senhousia to MHWs and make a leap forward in linking climate change and biological fouling in marine ecosystems.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/36587491\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":304,"authors":"Shuai Sun, Qiang Zhang, Vijay P Singh, Chunxiang Shi, Gang Wang, Wenhuan Wu, Zexi Shen","title":"Increased moist heat stress risk across China under warming climate.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Heatwaves have afflicted human health, ecosystem, and socioeconomy and are expected to intensify under warming climate.

Children are particularly vulnerable to GCC due to developing organ systems, psychological immaturity, nature of daily activities, and higher level of per-body-unit exposure. There is a rising trend in the disease burden of childhood asthma and allergies in many parts of the world. The associations of CC, air pollution and other environmental exposures with childhood asthma are attracting more research attention, but relatively few studies have focused on CC adaptation measures and childhood asthma. This study aimed to bridge this knowledge gap and conducted the first systematic review on CC adaptation measures and childhood asthma. We searched electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science using a set of MeSH terms and related synonyms, and identified 20 eligible studies included for review. We found that there were a number of adaptation measures proposed for childhood asthma in response to GCC, including vulnerability assessment, improving ventilation and heating, enhancing community education, and developing forecast models and early warning systems. Several randomized controlled trials show that improving ventilation and installing heating in the homes appear to be an effective way to relieve childhood asthma symptoms, especially in winter. However, the effectiveness of most adaptation measures, except for improving ventilation and heating, have not been explored and quantified. Given more extreme weather events (e.g., cold spells and heatwaves) may occur as climate change progresses, this finding may have important implications. Evidently, further research is urgently warranted to evaluate the impacts of CC adaptation measures on childhood asthma. These adaptation measures, if proven to be effective, should be integrated in childhood asthma control and prevention programs as GCC continues.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/35644404\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":309,"authors":"Stanley Kin Nok Chan, Sneha Suresh, Phillip Munday, Timothy Ravasi, Mois\u00e9s A Bernal, Celia Schunter","title":"The alternative splicing landscape of a coral reef fish during a marine heatwave.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Alternative splicing is a molecular mechanism that enables a single gene to encode multiple transcripts and proteins by post-transcriptional modification of pre-RNA molecules.

Variability in formaldehyde (HCHO) concentrations in the troposphere is dominated by local emissions of short-lived biogenic (BVOC) and pyrogenic volatile organic compounds. BVOCs are emitted by plants in a rapid protective response to abiotic stress, mediated by the energetic status of leaves (the excess of reducing power when photosynthetic light and dark reactions are decoupled, as occurs when stomata close in response to water stress). Emissions also increase exponentially with leaf temperature. New analytical methods for the detection of spatiotemporally contiguous extremes in remote-sensing data are applied here to satellite-derived atmospheric HCHO columns. BVOC emissions are shown to play a central role in the formation of the largest positive HCHO anomalies. Although vegetation stress can be captured by various remotely sensed quantities, spaceborne HCHO emerges as the most consistent recorder of vegetation responses to the largest climate extremes, especially in forested regions.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/34510653\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":315,"authors":"Peng Zhang, Jee-Hoon Jeong, Jin-Ho Yoon, Hyungjun Kim, S-Y Simon Wang, Hans W Linderholm, Keyan Fang, Xiuchen Wu, Deliang Chen","title":"Abrupt shift to hotter and drier climate over inner East Asia beyond the tipping point.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Unprecedented heatwave-drought concurrences in the past two decades have been reported over inner East Asia.

A wide range of methodologies have been utilized to issue warnings, as there is no universal definition of \"heat event\" or \"heatwave\", nor are there quantified thresholds of human-health tolerance to extreme weather. The performance of these warning systems has rarely been evaluated with actual heat-health data, especially the morbidity data, in regions with severe impact. In this study, we assessed the performance of the Shanghai HHWS based on heat-related illness data collected by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) and then conducted a comparative analysis among the Shanghai HHWS, the China Meteorological Administration HHWS, the Chinese national standard for heatwave indexes, the heat index adopted by the USA's National Weather Service and the definition suggested by the World Meteorological Organization to understand their potential performance for application in Shanghai and to evaluate the temperature thresholds and different meteorological indices employed. The results show that: 1) during the research period, 50% of heat-related illnesses and 58.2% of heat-related deaths in Shanghai occurred on dates that had no heat warnings; 2) for the current threshold (35\u00a0\u00b0C), the single metric of temperature outperformed the temperature-duration two-parameter method; 3) different from existing studies, while infants and seniors are deemed as vulnerable population groups to heat, young and middle-aged males were found to suffer more heat-related illnesses in hot weather. More detailed analyses reveal that the performance of heat-health warning systems needs to be evaluated and revised periodically, and warning thresholds utilized must be localized to reflect public tolerance to heat and to address the vulnerability of target population groups. Temperature is the dominant threshold in heat-related morbidity and mortality analysis. While a decrease in the temperature threshold would definitely increase the warning frequency and socioeconomic costs, it might also cause warning fatigue. The trade-off between these two aspects is essential for decision-makers and other stakeholders in HHWS design and improvement.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/32006779\/","source":"pubmed"}],"Heatwaves Warning Systems other sources":"No"}

Recent studies have suggested that variability in GPP is driven by a broad range of biotic and abiotic factors operating mainly through changes in vegetation phenology and physiological processes. However, it is still unclear how plant phenology and physiology can be integrated to explain the spatiotemporal variability of terrestrial GPP. Based on analyses of eddy-covariance and satellite-derived data, we decomposed annual terrestrial GPP into the length of the CO2 uptake period (CUP) and the seasonal maximal capacity of CO2 uptake (GPPmax). The product of CUP and GPPmax explained >90% of the temporal GPP variability in most areas of North America during 2000-2010 and the spatial GPP variation among globally distributed eddy flux tower sites. It also explained GPP response to the European heatwave in 2003 (r(2) = 0.90) and GPP recovery after a fire disturbance in South Dakota (r(2) = 0.88). Additional analysis of the eddy-covariance flux data shows that the interbiome variation in annual GPP is better explained by that in GPPmax than CUP. These findings indicate that terrestrial GPP is jointly controlled by ecosystem-level plant phenology and photosynthetic capacity, and greater understanding of GPPmax and CUP responses to environmental and biological variations will, thus, improve predictions of GPP over time and space.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/25730847\/","source":"pubmed"}],"Heatwaves Warning Systems other sources":"No"}

For continuous ocean habitats this reorganization is characterized by large-scale species redistribution, but for tropical discontinuous habitats such as coral reefs, spatial isolation coupled with strong habitat dependence of fish species imply that turnover and local extinctions are more significant mechanisms. In these systems, transient marine heatwaves are causing coral bleaching and profoundly altering habitat structure, yet despite severe bleaching events becoming more frequent and projections indicating annual severe bleaching by the 2050s at most reefs, long-term effects on the diversity and structure of fish assemblages remain unclear. Using a 23-year time series spanning a thermal stress event, we describe and model structural changes and recovery trajectories of fish communities after mass bleaching. Communities changed fundamentally, with the new emergent communities dominated by herbivores and persisting for >15\u00a0years, a period exceeding realized and projected intervals between thermal stress events on coral reefs. Reefs which shifted to macroalgal states had the lowest species richness and highest compositional dissimilarity, whereas reefs where live coral recovered exceeded prebleaching fish richness, but remained dissimilar to prebleaching compositions. Given realized and projected frequencies of bleaching events, our results show that fish communities historically associated with coral reefs will not re-establish, requiring substantial adaptation by managers and resource users.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/31210001\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":280,"authors":"Jianyang Xia, Shuli Niu, Philippe Ciais, Ivan A Janssens, Jiquan Chen, Christof Ammann, Altaf Arain, Peter D Blanken, Alessandro Cescatti, Damien Bonal, Nina Buchmann, Peter S Curtis, Shiping Chen, Jinwei Dong, Lawrence B Flanagan, Christian Frankenberg, Teodoro Georgiadis, Christopher M Gough, Dafeng Hui, Gerard Kiely, Jianwei Li, Magnus Lund, Vincenzo Magliulo, Barbara Marcolla, Lutz Merbold, Leonardo Montagnani, Eddy J Moors, J\u00f8rgen E Olesen, Shilong Piao, Antonio Raschi, Olivier Roupsard, Andrew E Suyker, Marek Urbaniak, Francesco P Vaccari, Andrej Varlagin, Timo Vesala, Matthew Wilkinson, Ensheng Weng, Georg Wohlfahrt, Liming Yan, Yiqi Luo","title":"Joint control of terrestrial gross primary productivity by plant phenology and physiology.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) varies greatly over time and space.

However, empirical evidence explicitly linking MPAs to enhanced ecological resilience is limited and mixed. To better understand whether MPAs can buffer climate impacts, we tested the resistance and recovery of marine communities to the 2014-2016 Northeast Pacific heatwave in the largest scientifically designed MPA network in the world off the coast of California, United States. The network consists of 124 MPAs (48 no-take state marine reserves, and 76 partial-take or special regulation conservation areas) implemented at different times, with full implementation completed in 2012. We compared fish, benthic invertebrate, and macroalgal community structure inside and outside of 13 no-take MPAs across rocky intertidal, kelp forest, shallow reef, and deep reef nearshore habitats in California's Central Coast region from 2007 to 2020. We also explored whether MPA features, including age, size, depth, proportion rock, historic fishing pressure, habitat diversity and richness, connectivity, and fish biomass response ratios (proxy for ecological performance), conferred climate resilience for kelp forest and rocky intertidal habitats spanning 28 MPAs across the full network. Ecological communities dramatically shifted due to the marine heatwave across all four nearshore habitats, and MPAs did not facilitate habitat-wide resistance or recovery. Only in protected rocky intertidal habitats did community structure significantly resist marine heatwave impacts. Community shifts were associated with a pronounced decline in the relative proportion of cold water species and an increase in warm water species. MPA features did not explain resistance or recovery to the marine heatwave. Collectively, our findings suggest that MPAs have limited ability to mitigate the impacts of marine heatwaves on community structure. Given that mechanisms of resilience to climate perturbations are complex, there is a clear need to expand assessments of ecosystem-wide consequences resulting from acute climate-driven perturbations, and the potential role of regulatory protection in mitigating community structure changes.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/37439293\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":125,"authors":"Anna Alari, Noemie Letellier, Tarik Benmarhnia","title":"Effect of different heat wave timing on cardiovascular and respiratory mortality in France.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Previous epidemiological evidence suggests that the impact of heat waves on mortality may change over time within the summer season.

Over the last 20\u00a0years, three major coral bleaching events occurred in concomitance with anomalous heatwaves, provoking a severe loss of coral cover worldwide. The conservation strategies for preserving reefs, as they are implemented now, cannot cope with global climatic shifts. Consequently, researchers are advocating for preservation networks to be set-up to reinforce coral adaptive potential. However, the main obstacle to this implementation is that studies on coral adaption are usually hard to generalize at the scale of a reef system. Here, we study the relationships between genotype frequencies and environmental characteristics of the sea (seascape genomics), in combination with connectivity analysis, to investigate the adaptive potential of a flagship coral species of the Ryukyu Archipelago (Japan). By associating genotype frequencies with descriptors of historical environmental conditions, we discovered six genomic regions hosting polymorphisms that might promote resistance against heat stress. Remarkably, annotations of genes in these regions were consistent with molecular roles associated with heat responses. Furthermore, we combined information on genetic and spatial distances between reefs to predict connectivity at a regional scale. The combination of these results portrayed the adaptive potential of this population: we were able to identify reefs carrying potential heat stress adapted genotypes and to understand how they disperse to neighbouring reefs. This information was summarized by objective, quantifiable and mappable indices covering the whole region, which can be extremely useful for future prioritization of reefs in conservation planning. This framework is transferable to any coral species on any reef system and therefore represents a valuable tool for empowering preservation efforts dedicated to the protection of coral reefs in warming oceans.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/32908595\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":130,"authors":"Alexander Graf, Anne Klosterhalfen, Nicola Arriga, Christian Bernhofer, Heye Bogena, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bornet, Nicolas Br\u00fcggemann, Christian Br\u00fcmmer, Nina Buchmann, Jinshu Chi, Christophe Chipeaux, Edoardo Cremonese, Matthias Cuntz, Ji\u0159\u00ed Du\u0161ek, Tarek S El-Madany, Silvano Fares, Milan Fischer, Lenka Folt\u00fdnov\u00e1, Mana Gharun, Shiva Ghiasi, Bert Gielen, Pia Gottschalk, Thomas Gr\u00fcnwald, G\u00fcnther Heinemann, Bernard Heinesch, Michal Heliasz, Jutta Holst, Lukas H\u00f6rtnagl, Andreas Ibrom, Joachim Ingwersen, Gerald Jurasinski, Janina Klatt, Alexander Knohl, Franziska Koebsch, Jan Konopka, Mika Korkiakoski, Natalia Kowalska, Pascal Kremer, Bart Kruijt, Sebastien Lafont, Jo\u00ebl L\u00e9onard, Anne De Ligne, Bernard Longdoz, Denis Loustau, Vincenzo Magliulo, Ivan Mammarella, Giovanni Manca, Matthias Mauder, Mirco Migliavacca, Meelis M\u00f6lder, Johan Neirynck, Patrizia Ney, Mats Nilsson, Eug\u00e9nie Paul-Limoges, Matthias Peichl, Andrea Pitacco, Arne Poyda, Corinna Rebmann, Marilyn Roland, Torsten Sachs, Marius Schmidt, Frederik Schrader, Lukas Siebicke, Ladislav \u0160igut, Eeva-Stiina Tuittila, Andrej Varlagin, Nadia Vendrame, Caroline Vincke, Ingo V\u00f6lksch, Stephan Weber, Christian Wille, Hans-Dieter Wizemann, Matthias Zeeman, Harry Vereecken","title":"Altered energy partitioning across terrestrial ecosystems in the European drought year 2018.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Drought and heat events, such as the 2018 European drought, interact with the exchange of energy between the land surface and the atmosphere, potentially affecting albedo, sensible and latent heat fluxes, as well as CO","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/32892732\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":131,"authors":"Yasmine Baghdadi, Anne Gallay, C\u00e9line Caserio-Sch\u00f6nemann, Anne Fouillet","title":"Evaluation of the French reactive mortality surveillance system supporting decision making.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"In France, a mortality syndromic surveillance system was set up with objectives of early detection and reactive evaluation of the impact of expected and unexpected events to support decision makers.

Increased climatic variability is expected to have different effects on species and ecosystems than gradual warming. A key challenge to predict the impact of climate change is to understand how temperature changes will affect species interactions. Herbivorous insects and their natural enemies belong to some of the largest groups of terrestrial animals, and thus they have a great impact on the functioning of ecosystems and on the services these ecosystems provide. Here we studied the life history traits of the plant-feeding insect Plutella xylostella and its specialist endoparasitoid Diadegma semiclausum, when exposed to a daily heat pulse of 5 or 10\u00b0C temperature increase during their entire immature phase. Growth and developmental responses differed with the amplitude of the heat pulse and they were different between host and parasitoid, indicating different thermal sensitivity of the two trophic levels. With a +5\u00b0C heat pulse, the adult parasitoids were larger which may result in a higher fitness, whereas a +10\u00b0C heat pulse retarded parasitoid development. These results show that the parasitoid is more sensitive than its host to brief intervals of temperature change, and this results in either positive or negative effects on life history traits, depending on the amplitude of the heat pulse. These findings suggest that more extreme fluctuations may disrupt host-parasitoid synchrony, whereas moderate fluctuations may improve parasitoid fitness.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/28453570\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":134,"authors":"Jianyang Xia, Shuli Niu, Philippe Ciais, Ivan A Janssens, Jiquan Chen, Christof Ammann, Altaf Arain, Peter D Blanken, Alessandro Cescatti, Damien Bonal, Nina Buchmann, Peter S Curtis, Shiping Chen, Jinwei Dong, Lawrence B Flanagan, Christian Frankenberg, Teodoro Georgiadis, Christopher M Gough, Dafeng Hui, Gerard Kiely, Jianwei Li, Magnus Lund, Vincenzo Magliulo, Barbara Marcolla, Lutz Merbold, Leonardo Montagnani, Eddy J Moors, J\u00f8rgen E Olesen, Shilong Piao, Antonio Raschi, Olivier Roupsard, Andrew E Suyker, Marek Urbaniak, Francesco P Vaccari, Andrej Varlagin, Timo Vesala, Matthew Wilkinson, Ensheng Weng, Georg Wohlfahrt, Liming Yan, Yiqi Luo","title":"Joint control of terrestrial gross primary productivity by plant phenology and physiology.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) varies greatly over time and space. A better understanding of this variability is necessary for more accurate predictions of the future climate-carbon cycle feedback. Recent studies have suggested that variability in GPP is driven by a broad range of biotic and abiotic factors operating mainly through changes in vegetation phenology and physiological processes. However, it is still unclear how plant phenology and physiology can be integrated to explain the spatiotemporal variability of terrestrial GPP. Based on analyses of eddy-covariance and satellite-derived data, we decomposed annual terrestrial GPP into the length of the CO2 uptake period (CUP) and the seasonal maximal capacity of CO2 uptake (GPPmax). The product of CUP and GPPmax explained >90% of the temporal GPP variability in most areas of North America during 2000-2010 and the spatial GPP variation among globally distributed eddy flux tower sites. It also explained GPP response to the European heatwave in 2003 (r(2) = 0.90) and GPP recovery after a fire disturbance in South Dakota (r(2) = 0.88). Additional analysis of the eddy-covariance flux data shows that the interbiome variation in annual GPP is better explained by that in GPPmax than CUP. These findings indicate that terrestrial GPP is jointly controlled by ecosystem-level plant phenology and photosynthetic capacity, and greater understanding of GPPmax and CUP responses to environmental and biological variations will, thus, improve predictions of GPP over time and space.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/25730847\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":135,"authors":"M Pascal, A C Viso, S Medina, M C Delmas, P Beaudeau","title":"How can a climate change perspective be integrated into public health surveillance?","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Climate change may be considered as a key factor for environmental change, exposure to health risks and pathogens, consequently impairing the state of health among populations.

However, empirical evidence explicitly linking MPAs to enhanced ecological resilience is limited and mixed. To better understand whether MPAs can buffer climate impacts, we tested the resistance and recovery of marine communities to the 2014-2016 Northeast Pacific heatwave in the largest scientifically designed MPA network in the world off the coast of California, United States. The network consists of 124 MPAs (48 no-take state marine reserves, and 76 partial-take or special regulation conservation areas) implemented at different times, with full implementation completed in 2012. We compared fish, benthic invertebrate, and macroalgal community structure inside and outside of 13 no-take MPAs across rocky intertidal, kelp forest, shallow reef, and deep reef nearshore habitats in California's Central Coast region from 2007 to 2020. We also explored whether MPA features, including age, size, depth, proportion rock, historic fishing pressure, habitat diversity and richness, connectivity, and fish biomass response ratios (proxy for ecological performance), conferred climate resilience for kelp forest and rocky intertidal habitats spanning 28 MPAs across the full network. Ecological communities dramatically shifted due to the marine heatwave across all four nearshore habitats, and MPAs did not facilitate habitat-wide resistance or recovery. Only in protected rocky intertidal habitats did community structure significantly resist marine heatwave impacts. Community shifts were associated with a pronounced decline in the relative proportion of cold water species and an increase in warm water species. MPA features did not explain resistance or recovery to the marine heatwave. Collectively, our findings suggest that MPAs have limited ability to mitigate the impacts of marine heatwaves on community structure. Given that mechanisms of resilience to climate perturbations are complex, there is a clear need to expand assessments of ecosystem-wide consequences resulting from acute climate-driven perturbations, and the potential role of regulatory protection in mitigating community structure changes.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/37439293\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":58,"authors":null,"title":"Global burden of chronic respiratory diseases and risk factors, 1990-2019: an update from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Updated data on chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) are vital in their prevention, control, and treatment in the path to achieving the third UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a one-third reduction in premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by 2030.

Evidence from previous extreme heat events across the globe demonstrates that adverse cardiovascular events are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly amongst the elderly and those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. However, less is understood about the adverse effects of extreme heat amongst specific cardiovascular diseases (i.e., heart failure, dysrhythmias) and demographics (sex, ethnicity, age) within Australia and New Zealand. Furthermore, although Australia has implemented regional and state heat warning systems, most personal heat-health protective advice available in public health policy documents is either insufficient, not grounded in scientific evidence, and\/or does not consider clinical factors such as age or co-morbidities. Dissemination of evidence-based recommendations and enhancing community resilience to extreme heat disasters within Australia and New Zealand should be an area of critical focus to reduce the burden and negative health effects associated with extreme heat.

Moreover, phase shifts in this region have mostly been characterized by the emergence of algae and, less typically, zoantharians. However, nutrient excess and organic pollution are key drivers of the hard coral habitat degradation and may, thus, favor the emergence of novel zoantharian-dominated habitats. Many zoantharian species, particularly those from the genera Palythoa and Zoanthus, have traits that could help them thrive under conditions detrimental to reef-building corals, including rapid growth, several asexual reproduction strategies, high morphological plasticity, and generalist nutrient acquisition strategies. Thus, in a near future, stress-tolerant zoantharians may thrive in nutrient-enriched subtidal SWA locations under low heat stress, such as, upwelling. Overall, coral-zoantharian phase shifts in the SWA may decrease the species richness of reef communities, ultimately influencing ecosystem functioning and services, such as the provision of nursery habitats, fish biomass production, and coastline protection. However, zoantharians will also be threatened at intertidal zones, which are expected to experience higher heat stress, solar radiation, and sea-level rise. Although zoantharians appear to cope well with some local stressors (e.g., decreasing water quality), they are vulnerable to climate change (e.g., heatwaves), invasive species (Tubastraea spp.), microplastics, diseases, and mostly restricted to a narrow depth range (0-15\u00a0m depth) in SWA reefs. This shallow zone is particularly affected by climate change, compressing the three-dimensional habitat and limiting depth refugia in deeper SWA reefs. As mesophotic ecosystems have been hypothesized as short-term refuges to disturbances for some species, the narrow depth limit of zoantharians seems to be a potential factor that might increase their vulnerability to growing climate change pressures in SWA shallow-water reefs. Together, these could lead to both range expansions in some locations and loss of suitable reef habitats in other sites. Additional research is needed to better understand the systemic responses of these novel SWA reefs to the concert of increasing and interactive local and global stressors, and their implications for ecosystem functioning and service provisions.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/34879290\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":112,"authors":"Romy Rehschuh, Nadine K Ruehr","title":"Diverging responses of water and carbon relations during and after heat and hot drought stress in Pinus sylvestris.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Forests are increasingly affected by heatwaves, often co-occurring with drought, with consequences for water and carbon (C) cycling. However, our ability to project tree resilience to more intense hot droughts remains limited. Here, we used single tree chambers (n\u00a0=\u00a018) to investigate transpiration (E), net assimilation (Anet), root respiration (Rroot) and stem diameter change in Scots pine seedlings in a control treatment and during gradually intensifying heat or drought-heat stress (max. 42\u00a0\u00b0C), including recovery. Alongside this, we assessed indicators of stress impacts and recovery capacities. In the heat treatment, excessive leaf heating was mitigated via increased E, while under drought-heat, E ceased and leaf temperatures reached 46\u00a0\u00b0C. However, leaf electrolyte leakage was negligible, while light-adapted quantum yield of photosystem II (F'v\/F'm) declined alongside Anet moderately in heat, but strongly in drought-heat seedlings, in which respiration exceeded C uptake. Drought-heat largely affected the hydraulic system as apparent in stem diameter shrinkage, declining relative needle water content (RWCNeedle) and water potential (\u03a8Needle) reaching -2.7\u00a0MPa, alongside a 90% decline of leaf hydraulic conductance (KLeaf). Heat alone resulted in low functional impairment and all measured parameters recovered quickly. Contrary, following drought-heat, the recovery of KLeaf was incomplete and stem hydraulic conductivity (KS) was 25% lower than the control. However, F'v\/F'm recovered and the tree net C balance reached control values 2\u00a0days post-stress, with stem increment rates accelerating during the second recovery week. This indicates a new equilibrium of C uptake and release in drought-heat seedlings independent of hydraulic impairment, which may slowly contribute to the repair of damaged tissues. In summary, Scots pine recovered rapidly following moderate heat stress, while combined with drought, hydraulic and thermal stress intensified, resulting in functional damage and slow recovery of hydraulic conductance. This incomplete hydraulic recovery could critically limit evaporative cooling capacities and C uptake under repeated heatwaves.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/34740258\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":113,"authors":"Luis Gim\u00e9nez, Adreeja Chatterjee, Gabriela Torres","title":"A state-space approach to understand responses of organisms, populations and communities to multiple environmental drivers.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Understanding the response of biotic systems to multiple environmental drivers is one of the major concerns in ecology.

In partnership with The Lancet and the MJA, we present the inaugural Australian Countdown assessment of progress on climate change and health. This comprehensive assessment examines 41 indicators across five broad sections: climate change impacts, exposures and vulnerability; adaptation, planning and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement. These indicators and the methods used for each are largely consistent with those of the Lancet Countdown global assessment published in October 2017, but with an Australian focus. Significant developments include the addition of a new indicator on mental health. Overall, we find that Australia is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change on health, and that policy inaction in this regard threatens Australian lives. In a number of respects, Australia has gone backwards and now lags behind other high income countries such as Germany and the United Kingdom. Examples include the persistence of a very high carbon-intensive energy system in Australia, and its slow transition to renewables and low carbon electricity generation. However, we also find some examples of good progress, such as heatwave response planning. Given the overall poor state of progress on climate change and health in Australia, this country now has an enormous opportunity to take action and protect human health and lives. Australia has the technical knowhow and intellect to do this, and our annual updates of this assessment will track Australia's engagement with and progress on this vitally important issue.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/30521429\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":121,"authors":"Meili Feng, Guido Zolezzi, Martin Pusch","title":"Effects of thermopeaking on the thermal response of alpine river systems to heatwaves.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Within the past 30years there have been two major heatwave events (in 2003 and 2006) that broke 500-year-old temperature records in Europe. Owing to the growing concern of rising temperatures, we analyzed the potential response in a number of river sections that are subject to hydropeaking and thermopeaking through the intermittent release of water from hydropower stations. Thermopeaking in alpine streams is known to intermittently cool down the river water in summer and to warm it up in winter. We analyzed the response of river water temperature to air temperature during heatwaves at 19 gauging stations across Switzerland, using a 30-yr dataset at a 10-min resolution. Stations were either classified into \"unpeaked\" or \"peaked\" groups according to four statistical indicators related to hydropeaking and thermopeaking pressure. Peaked stations were exposed to reduced temporal variability in river water temperature, and it was determined that correlations between river water and air temperature were weaker for peaked stations compared with unpeaked stations. Similarly, peaked stations showed a much weaker response to heatwaves compared with unpeaked stations. It is important to note that this \"cooling effect\" created by hydro-thermopeaking was most pronounced during the two major heatwave events that took place in 2003 and 2006. Furthermore, results from thermal stress events on the growth of a typical cold eurythermic fish species (brown trout) increased continuously in rivers subject to peaked station water release during heatwaves. While hydropower operations that take place high up on mountains releasing hypolimnetic water may mitigate the adverse effects of heatwaves on downstream alpine river ecosystems locally, our results show the complexity of an artificial physical template associated with flow regime regulation in alpine streams.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/28898932\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":122,"authors":"Ningning Zhang, Ming Feng, Harry H Hendon, Alistair J Hobday, Jens Zinke","title":"Opposite polarities of ENSO drive distinct patterns of coral bleaching potentials in the southeast Indian Ocean.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Episodic anomalously warm sea surface temperature (SST) extremes, or marine heatwaves (MHWs), amplify ocean warming effects and may lead to severe impacts on marine ecosystems. MHW-induced coral bleaching events have been observed frequently in recent decades in the southeast Indian Ocean (SEIO), a region traditionally regarded to have resilience to global warming. In this study, we assess the contribution of El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) to MHWs across the mostly understudied reefs in the SEIO. We find that in extended summer months, the MHWs at tropical and subtropical reefs (divided at ~20\u00b0S) are driven by opposite ENSO polarities: MHWs are more likely to occur at the tropical reefs during eastern Pacific El Ni\u00f1o, driven by enhanced solar radiation and weaker Australian Monsoon, some likely alleviated by positive Indian Ocean Dipole events, and at the subtropical reefs during central Pacific La Ni\u00f1a, mainly caused by increased horizontal heat transport, and in some cases reinforced by local air-sea interactions. Madden-Julian Oscillations (MJO) also modulate the MHW occurrences. Projected future increases in ENSO and MJO intensity with greenhouse warming will enhance thermal stress across the SEIO. Implementing forecasting systems of MHWs can be used to anticipate future coral bleaching patterns and prepare management responses.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/28550298\/","source":"pubmed"}],"Heatwaves Warning Systems other sources":"No"}

Advective heat flux in the form of a dualistic circulation system is found responsible for exacerbating the urban overheating magnitude (\u0394T) during the HWs and altering the available energy balance. Land-coastal distance is also found as an important contributor in magnifying the urban-suburban temperature contrast.

In the present study, we have computed the extreme precipitation and temperature indices over the 10 agro-climatic zones falling under the Ganga River Basin (GRB)utilizing a high-resolution daily gridded temperature and precipitation multi-model ensembled CMIP6 dataset (0.25\u00b0\u2009\u00d7\u20090.25\u00b0) under global warming levels of 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C, 2\u00a0\u00b0C, and 3\u00a0\u00b0C. We found that the annual daily minimum temperature (TNN) showed a higher rise of about 67% than the maximum temperature (TXX) of 48% in GRB. The basin also experiences a greater increase in the frequency of warm nights (TN90P) of about 67.71% compared to warm days (TX90P) of 29.1% for the 3\u00a0\u00b0C global warming level. Along with extreme indices, the population exposed due to the impact of the extreme maximum temperature has also been analyzed for progressive warming levels. Population exposure to extreme temperature event (TXX) has been analyzed with 20-year return period using GEV distribution method. The study concludes that the exposed population to extreme temperature event experienced an increase from 46.99 to 52.16% for the whole Ganga Basin. Consecutive dry days (CDD) and consecutive wet days (CWD) both show a significant increasing trend, but CWD has a significant increase in the majority of the zones, while CDD shows a significant decreasing trend for some of the zones for three warming levels periods. Extreme climate indices help to understand the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall, droughts, and heatwaves to develop early warning systems and adaptation strategies to mitigate such events.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/37592096\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":318,"authors":null,"title":"Global burden of chronic respiratory diseases and risk factors, 1990-2019: an update from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Updated data on chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) are vital in their prevention, control, and treatment in the path to achieving the third UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a one-third reduction in premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by 2030.

A better understanding of this variability is necessary for more accurate predictions of the future climate-carbon cycle feedback. Recent studies have suggested that variability in GPP is driven by a broad range of biotic and abiotic factors operating mainly through changes in vegetation phenology and physiological processes. However, it is still unclear how plant phenology and physiology can be integrated to explain the spatiotemporal variability of terrestrial GPP. Based on analyses of eddy-covariance and satellite-derived data, we decomposed annual terrestrial GPP into the length of the CO2 uptake period (CUP) and the seasonal maximal capacity of CO2 uptake (GPPmax). The product of CUP and GPPmax explained >90% of the temporal GPP variability in most areas of North America during 2000-2010 and the spatial GPP variation among globally distributed eddy flux tower sites. It also explained GPP response to the European heatwave in 2003 (r(2) = 0.90) and GPP recovery after a fire disturbance in South Dakota (r(2) = 0.88). Additional analysis of the eddy-covariance flux data shows that the interbiome variation in annual GPP is better explained by that in GPPmax than CUP. These findings indicate that terrestrial GPP is jointly controlled by ecosystem-level plant phenology and photosynthetic capacity, and greater understanding of GPPmax and CUP responses to environmental and biological variations will, thus, improve predictions of GPP over time and space.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/25730847\/","source":"pubmed"}],"Heatwaves Warning Systems other sources":"No"}

Along the studied period macrobenthic community showed marked fluctuations, in terms of richness, diversity, biological traits and ecological groups, which could be related with environmental instability of the lagoon. At the same time, a general tendency towards a deterioration of ecological condition of the lagoon was observed, with a general decrease in species richness, diversity, percentage of sensitive species, and a general increase in the proportion of the more opportunistic trait modalities, such as deposit feeders, burrowing, infaunal and short living animals. Increasing yearly temperature explained only a small part of the variability of macrobenthic community, in terms of biological traits and diversity indices, and this was likely due to the effect of natural fluctuations of environmental parameters and anthropogenic disturbance. Nevertheless, all metrics used are consistent in identifying the response of benthic community to a severe disturbance, likely related with the summer heatwave in 2003. Less marked signs of disturbance were observed also in relations to the thermal anomaly of 2012. Biological Traits Analysis combined with more classical structural and ecological indices, proved to be efficient in identifying temporal changes of the community. Our results suggest that the expected increase in frequency, magnitude and duration of heatwaves could pose serious threat to the resilience capacity of lagoonal macrobenthic community.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/29523351\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":192,"authors":"Meili Feng, Guido Zolezzi, Martin Pusch","title":"Effects of thermopeaking on the thermal response of alpine river systems to heatwaves.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Within the past 30years there have been two major heatwave events (in 2003 and 2006) that broke 500-year-old temperature records in Europe. Owing to the growing concern of rising temperatures, we analyzed the potential response in a number of river sections that are subject to hydropeaking and thermopeaking through the intermittent release of water from hydropower stations. Thermopeaking in alpine streams is known to intermittently cool down the river water in summer and to warm it up in winter. We analyzed the response of river water temperature to air temperature during heatwaves at 19 gauging stations across Switzerland, using a 30-yr dataset at a 10-min resolution. Stations were either classified into \"unpeaked\" or \"peaked\" groups according to four statistical indicators related to hydropeaking and thermopeaking pressure. Peaked stations were exposed to reduced temporal variability in river water temperature, and it was determined that correlations between river water and air temperature were weaker for peaked stations compared with unpeaked stations. Similarly, peaked stations showed a much weaker response to heatwaves compared with unpeaked stations. It is important to note that this \"cooling effect\" created by hydro-thermopeaking was most pronounced during the two major heatwave events that took place in 2003 and 2006. Furthermore, results from thermal stress events on the growth of a typical cold eurythermic fish species (brown trout) increased continuously in rivers subject to peaked station water release during heatwaves. While hydropower operations that take place high up on mountains releasing hypolimnetic water may mitigate the adverse effects of heatwaves on downstream alpine river ecosystems locally, our results show the complexity of an artificial physical template associated with flow regime regulation in alpine streams.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/28898932\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":193,"authors":"Dilek Killi, Filippo Bussotti, Antonio Raschi, Matthew Haworth","title":"Adaptation to high temperature mitigates the impact of water deficit during combined heat and drought stress in C3 sunflower and C4 maize varieties with contrasting drought tolerance.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Heat and drought stress frequently occur together, however, their impact on plant growth and photosynthesis (P","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/27535211\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":194,"authors":"Maria Concetta de Pinto, Vittoria Locato, Annalisa Paradiso, Laura De Gara","title":"Role of redox homeostasis in thermo-tolerance under a climate change scenario.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Climate change predictions indicate a progressive increase in average temperatures and an increase in the frequency of heatwaves, which will have a negative impact on crop productivity.

A better understanding of this variability is necessary for more accurate predictions of the future climate-carbon cycle feedback. Recent studies have suggested that variability in GPP is driven by a broad range of biotic and abiotic factors operating mainly through changes in vegetation phenology and physiological processes. However, it is still unclear how plant phenology and physiology can be integrated to explain the spatiotemporal variability of terrestrial GPP. Based on analyses of eddy-covariance and satellite-derived data, we decomposed annual terrestrial GPP into the length of the CO2 uptake period (CUP) and the seasonal maximal capacity of CO2 uptake (GPPmax). The product of CUP and GPPmax explained >90% of the temporal GPP variability in most areas of North America during 2000-2010 and the spatial GPP variation among globally distributed eddy flux tower sites. It also explained GPP response to the European heatwave in 2003 (r(2) = 0.90) and GPP recovery after a fire disturbance in South Dakota (r(2) = 0.88). Additional analysis of the eddy-covariance flux data shows that the interbiome variation in annual GPP is better explained by that in GPPmax than CUP. These findings indicate that terrestrial GPP is jointly controlled by ecosystem-level plant phenology and photosynthetic capacity, and greater understanding of GPPmax and CUP responses to environmental and biological variations will, thus, improve predictions of GPP over time and space.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/25730847\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":196,"authors":"Franziska Matthies, Bettina Menne","title":"Prevention and management of health hazards related to heatwaves.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"The general aim of the EuroHEAT project was to improve public health responses to weather extremes and, in particular, to heatwaves.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/19331238\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":197,"authors":"Bruno Christian Ciancio, Massimiliano Di Renzi, Nancy Binkin, Alberto Perra, Rosa Prato, Antonino Bella, Paolo Niutta, Fabrizio Rossi, Cinzia Germinario, Maria Teresa Balducci, Giovanni Caputi, Annarita Fusco","title":"[Risk factors for mortality during a heat-wave in Bari (Italy), summer 2005.].","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"The Italian Heat Health Watch Warning System (HHWWS) was set up following the over 3000 excess deaths which occurred in Italy during the heat wave of 2003, In June 2005 the warning system issued a heat warning in various Italian cities.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/18223698\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":198,"authors":"Giuseppe Mastrangelo, Ugo Fedeli, Cristiana Visentin, Giovanni Milan, Emanuela Fadda, Paolo Spolaore","title":"Pattern and determinants of hospitalization during heat waves: an ecologic study.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Numerous studies have investigated mortality during a heatwave, while few have quantified heat associated morbidity.

All patients had decreased platelet count and coagulation abnormalities. Two patients were hypertensive, 4 hypotensive. The heat stress due to the hot environment is characterized by systemic inflammatory response (as in severe sepsis) and hemodynamic impairment (as in hypovolemic shock). The association between hypovolemia and altered microcirculation leads to cell energy failure with metabolic lactic acidosis. The energy failure may induce structural irreversible damage of mitochondria. It is possible to differentiate, during energy failure, the irreversible or reversible condition by volume loading and vasoactive drugs challenge tests. In fact, if the hemodynamic correction is associated with normalization of SvO2 with disappearance of metabolic acidosis, this suggests hemodynamic impairment with intact mitochondrial function. In contrast, if the hemodynamic improvement with normalization of SvO2 is associated and acidosis persists, this suggests irreversible structural mitochondrial damage. The threshold between reversibility and irreversibility is likely time dependent, as suggested by biochemical consideration and by 2 large randomized studies on hemodynamic treatment. The comparative analysis of these 2 studies suggests that the time of intervention may lead to significant differences in mortality. In these patients time is essential.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/15252373\/","source":"pubmed"}],"Heatwaves Warning Systems other sources":"No"}

Moreover, phase shifts in this region have mostly been characterized by the emergence of algae and, less typically, zoantharians. However, nutrient excess and organic pollution are key drivers of the hard coral habitat degradation and may, thus, favor the emergence of novel zoantharian-dominated habitats. Many zoantharian species, particularly those from the genera Palythoa and Zoanthus, have traits that could help them thrive under conditions detrimental to reef-building corals, including rapid growth, several asexual reproduction strategies, high morphological plasticity, and generalist nutrient acquisition strategies. Thus, in a near future, stress-tolerant zoantharians may thrive in nutrient-enriched subtidal SWA locations under low heat stress, such as, upwelling. Overall, coral-zoantharian phase shifts in the SWA may decrease the species richness of reef communities, ultimately influencing ecosystem functioning and services, such as the provision of nursery habitats, fish biomass production, and coastline protection. However, zoantharians will also be threatened at intertidal zones, which are expected to experience higher heat stress, solar radiation, and sea-level rise. Although zoantharians appear to cope well with some local stressors (e.g., decreasing water quality), they are vulnerable to climate change (e.g., heatwaves), invasive species (Tubastraea spp.), microplastics, diseases, and mostly restricted to a narrow depth range (0-15\u00a0m depth) in SWA reefs. This shallow zone is particularly affected by climate change, compressing the three-dimensional habitat and limiting depth refugia in deeper SWA reefs. As mesophotic ecosystems have been hypothesized as short-term refuges to disturbances for some species, the narrow depth limit of zoantharians seems to be a potential factor that might increase their vulnerability to growing climate change pressures in SWA shallow-water reefs. Together, these could lead to both range expansions in some locations and loss of suitable reef habitats in other sites. Additional research is needed to better understand the systemic responses of these novel SWA reefs to the concert of increasing and interactive local and global stressors, and their implications for ecosystem functioning and service provisions.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/34879290\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":217,"authors":"Peng Zhang, Jee-Hoon Jeong, Jin-Ho Yoon, Hyungjun Kim, S-Y Simon Wang, Hans W Linderholm, Keyan Fang, Xiuchen Wu, Deliang Chen","title":"Abrupt shift to hotter and drier climate over inner East Asia beyond the tipping point.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Unprecedented heatwave-drought concurrences in the past two decades have been reported over inner East Asia.

Over the last 20\u00a0years, three major coral bleaching events occurred in concomitance with anomalous heatwaves, provoking a severe loss of coral cover worldwide. The conservation strategies for preserving reefs, as they are implemented now, cannot cope with global climatic shifts. Consequently, researchers are advocating for preservation networks to be set-up to reinforce coral adaptive potential. However, the main obstacle to this implementation is that studies on coral adaption are usually hard to generalize at the scale of a reef system. Here, we study the relationships between genotype frequencies and environmental characteristics of the sea (seascape genomics), in combination with connectivity analysis, to investigate the adaptive potential of a flagship coral species of the Ryukyu Archipelago (Japan). By associating genotype frequencies with descriptors of historical environmental conditions, we discovered six genomic regions hosting polymorphisms that might promote resistance against heat stress. Remarkably, annotations of genes in these regions were consistent with molecular roles associated with heat responses. Furthermore, we combined information on genetic and spatial distances between reefs to predict connectivity at a regional scale. The combination of these results portrayed the adaptive potential of this population: we were able to identify reefs carrying potential heat stress adapted genotypes and to understand how they disperse to neighbouring reefs. This information was summarized by objective, quantifiable and mappable indices covering the whole region, which can be extremely useful for future prioritization of reefs in conservation planning. This framework is transferable to any coral species on any reef system and therefore represents a valuable tool for empowering preservation efforts dedicated to the protection of coral reefs in warming oceans.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/32908595\/","source":"pubmed"}],"Heatwaves Warning Systems other sources":"No"}

Using an extensive time series of co-located reef fish community structure and habitat data spanning 12 years and the entire Australian continent, we found that reef fish community responses to changing temperatures and habitats are dynamic and widespread but regionally patchy. Shifts in composition and abundance of the fish community often occurred within 2 years of environmental or habitat change, although the relative importance of these two mechanisms of climate impact tended to differ between tropical and temperate zones. The clearest of these changes on temperate and subtropical reefs were temperature related, with responses measured by the reef fish thermal index indicating reshuffling according to the thermal affinities of species present. On low latitude coral reefs, the community generalization index indicated shifting dominance of habitat generalist fishes through time, concurrent with changing coral cover. Our results emphasize the importance of maintaining local ecological detail when scaling up datasets to inform national policies and global biodiversity targets.

The association between heatwaves and elderly mortality is highly researched in developed countries. In contrast, heatwave impact on hospital admissions has been insufficiently studied worldwide due to data availability and sensitivity. In our opinion, the relationship between heatwaves and hospital admissions is worthwhile to explore as it could have a profound impact on healthcare systems. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the associations between heatwaves and hospitalisations for the elderly by age group in Selangor, Malaysia, from 2010 to 2020. We further explored the impact of heatwaves on the risks of cause-specific hospital admissions across age groups within the elderly. This study applied generalized additive models (GAMs) with the Poisson family and distributed lag models (DLMs) to estimate the effect of heatwaves on hospitalisations. According to the findings, there was no significant increase in hospitalisations for those aged 60 and older during heatwaves; however, a rise in mean apparent temperature (ATmean) by 1 \u00b0C significantly increased the risk of hospital admission by 12.9%. Heatwaves had no immediate effects on hospital admissions among elderly patients, but significant delay effects were identified for ATmean with a lag of 0-3 days. The hospital admission rates of the elderly groups started declining after a 5-day average following the heatwave event. Females were found to be relatively more vulnerable than males during heatwave periods. Consequently, these results can provide a reference to improve public health strategies to target elderly people who are at the greatest risk of hospitalisations due to heatwaves. Development of early heatwave and health warning systems for the elderly would assist with preventing and reducing health risks while also minimising the burden on the whole hospital system in Selangor, Malaysia.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/37239636\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":208,"authors":null,"title":"Global burden of chronic respiratory diseases and risk factors, 1990-2019: an update from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Updated data on chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) are vital in their prevention, control, and treatment in the path to achieving the third UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a one-third reduction in premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by 2030.

Hence, we can better quantify the increasing hazard due to heatwaves in a warmer climate. We show that two 2010 high impact events-summer Russian heatwave and winter Dzud in Mongolia-are associated with atmospheric patterns that are exceptional compared to the typical ones but typical compared to the climatology of extremes.

As many cities in the global south, Santiago is highly segregated along socioeconomic lines, which offers an opportunity for studying the effects of concurrent heatwaves and ozone episodes on distinct zones of affluence and deprivation. Here, we combine existing datasets of social indicators and climate-sensitive health risks with weather and air quality observations to study the response to compound heat-ozone extremes of different socioeconomic strata. Attributable to spatial variations in the ground-level ozone burden (heavier for wealthy communities), we found that the mortality response to extreme heat (and the associated further ozone pollution) is stronger in affluent dwellers, regardless of comorbidities and lack of access to health care affecting disadvantaged population.

Heatwaves may affect macroinvertebrates' bioturbating behavior in intertidal areas, thereby altering the deposition-erosion balance at tidal flats. Moreover, small-scale topographic features on tidal flats can create tidal pools during the low tide, thus changing the heat capacity of tidal flats. These pools could then potentially operate as refuge environments during marine heatwaves. We studied behavior responses to heat waves using the well-known bioturbating cockle Cerastoderma edule as a model species. Different temperature regimes (i.e., fluctuating between 20 and 40 \u00b0C) and micro-topographies (i.e., presence vs. absence of tidal water pools) were mimicked in a mesocosm experiment with regular tidal regimes. Our results demonstrate that behavioral responses to heat stress strongly depend on the site-specific morphological features. Cockles covered by shallow water pools moved up when exposed to thermal stress, while burrowing deeper into the sediment in the absence of water pools. But in both cases, their migratory behavior increased under heat stress compared to regular ambient treatments. Moreover, long-term cumulative heat stress increased cockles' respiration rates and decreased their health conditions, causing mass mortality after four weeks of gradually increasing heat exposure. Overall, the present findings provide the first insights into how bioturbating behavior on tidal flats may change in response to global warming.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/35124053\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":376,"authors":"Kirsten Vanderplanken, Peter van den Hazel, Michael Marx, Ahmad Zia Shams, Debarati Guha-Sapir, Joris Adriaan Frank van Loenhout","title":"Governing heatwaves in Europe: comparing health policy and practices to better understand roles, responsibilities and collaboration.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"The expectation that climate change will further exacerbate extreme weather events such as heatwaves is of primary concern to policymakers and scientists.

Increased climatic variability is expected to have different effects on species and ecosystems than gradual warming. A key challenge to predict the impact of climate change is to understand how temperature changes will affect species interactions. Herbivorous insects and their natural enemies belong to some of the largest groups of terrestrial animals, and thus they have a great impact on the functioning of ecosystems and on the services these ecosystems provide. Here we studied the life history traits of the plant-feeding insect Plutella xylostella and its specialist endoparasitoid Diadegma semiclausum, when exposed to a daily heat pulse of 5 or 10\u00b0C temperature increase during their entire immature phase. Growth and developmental responses differed with the amplitude of the heat pulse and they were different between host and parasitoid, indicating different thermal sensitivity of the two trophic levels. With a +5\u00b0C heat pulse, the adult parasitoids were larger which may result in a higher fitness, whereas a +10\u00b0C heat pulse retarded parasitoid development. These results show that the parasitoid is more sensitive than its host to brief intervals of temperature change, and this results in either positive or negative effects on life history traits, depending on the amplitude of the heat pulse. These findings suggest that more extreme fluctuations may disrupt host-parasitoid synchrony, whereas moderate fluctuations may improve parasitoid fitness.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/28453570\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":380,"authors":"Jianyang Xia, Shuli Niu, Philippe Ciais, Ivan A Janssens, Jiquan Chen, Christof Ammann, Altaf Arain, Peter D Blanken, Alessandro Cescatti, Damien Bonal, Nina Buchmann, Peter S Curtis, Shiping Chen, Jinwei Dong, Lawrence B Flanagan, Christian Frankenberg, Teodoro Georgiadis, Christopher M Gough, Dafeng Hui, Gerard Kiely, Jianwei Li, Magnus Lund, Vincenzo Magliulo, Barbara Marcolla, Lutz Merbold, Leonardo Montagnani, Eddy J Moors, J\u00f8rgen E Olesen, Shilong Piao, Antonio Raschi, Olivier Roupsard, Andrew E Suyker, Marek Urbaniak, Francesco P Vaccari, Andrej Varlagin, Timo Vesala, Matthew Wilkinson, Ensheng Weng, Georg Wohlfahrt, Liming Yan, Yiqi Luo","title":"Joint control of terrestrial gross primary productivity by plant phenology and physiology.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) varies greatly over time and space. A better understanding of this variability is necessary for more accurate predictions of the future climate-carbon cycle feedback. Recent studies have suggested that variability in GPP is driven by a broad range of biotic and abiotic factors operating mainly through changes in vegetation phenology and physiological processes. However, it is still unclear how plant phenology and physiology can be integrated to explain the spatiotemporal variability of terrestrial GPP. Based on analyses of eddy-covariance and satellite-derived data, we decomposed annual terrestrial GPP into the length of the CO2 uptake period (CUP) and the seasonal maximal capacity of CO2 uptake (GPPmax). The product of CUP and GPPmax explained >90% of the temporal GPP variability in most areas of North America during 2000-2010 and the spatial GPP variation among globally distributed eddy flux tower sites. It also explained GPP response to the European heatwave in 2003 (r(2) = 0.90) and GPP recovery after a fire disturbance in South Dakota (r(2) = 0.88). Additional analysis of the eddy-covariance flux data shows that the interbiome variation in annual GPP is better explained by that in GPPmax than CUP. These findings indicate that terrestrial GPP is jointly controlled by ecosystem-level plant phenology and photosynthetic capacity, and greater understanding of GPPmax and CUP responses to environmental and biological variations will, thus, improve predictions of GPP over time and space.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/25730847\/","source":"pubmed"}],"Heatwaves Warning Systems other sources":"No"}

However, the main obstacle to this implementation is that studies on coral adaption are usually hard to generalize at the scale of a reef system. Here, we study the relationships between genotype frequencies and environmental characteristics of the sea (seascape genomics), in combination with connectivity analysis, to investigate the adaptive potential of a flagship coral species of the Ryukyu Archipelago (Japan). By associating genotype frequencies with descriptors of historical environmental conditions, we discovered six genomic regions hosting polymorphisms that might promote resistance against heat stress. Remarkably, annotations of genes in these regions were consistent with molecular roles associated with heat responses. Furthermore, we combined information on genetic and spatial distances between reefs to predict connectivity at a regional scale. The combination of these results portrayed the adaptive potential of this population: we were able to identify reefs carrying potential heat stress adapted genotypes and to understand how they disperse to neighbouring reefs. This information was summarized by objective, quantifiable and mappable indices covering the whole region, which can be extremely useful for future prioritization of reefs in conservation planning. This framework is transferable to any coral species on any reef system and therefore represents a valuable tool for empowering preservation efforts dedicated to the protection of coral reefs in warming oceans.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/32908595\/","source":"pubmed"}],"Heatwaves Warning Systems other sources":"No"}

Under all future climate change models, extreme heat events will continue to increase in frequency, duration, and intensity. Evidence from previous extreme heat events across the globe demonstrates that adverse cardiovascular events are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly amongst the elderly and those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. However, less is understood about the adverse effects of extreme heat amongst specific cardiovascular diseases (i.e., heart failure, dysrhythmias) and demographics (sex, ethnicity, age) within Australia and New Zealand. Furthermore, although Australia has implemented regional and state heat warning systems, most personal heat-health protective advice available in public health policy documents is either insufficient, not grounded in scientific evidence, and\/or does not consider clinical factors such as age or co-morbidities. Dissemination of evidence-based recommendations and enhancing community resilience to extreme heat disasters within Australia and New Zealand should be an area of critical focus to reduce the burden and negative health effects associated with extreme heat. This narrative review will focus on five key areas in relation to extreme heat events within Australia and New Zealand: 1) the potential physiological mechanisms that cause adverse cardiovascular outcomes during extreme heat events; 2) how big is the problem within Australia and New Zealand?; 3) what the heat-health response plans are; 4) research knowledge and translation; and, 5) knowledge gaps and areas for future research.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/36424263\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":204,"authors":"Jason Beringer, Caitlin E Moore, Jamie Cleverly, David I Campbell, Helen Cleugh, Martin G De Kauwe, Miko U F Kirschbaum, Anne Griebel, Sam Grover, Alfredo Huete, Lindsay B Hutley, Johannes Laubach, Tom Van Niel, Stefan K Arndt, Alison C Bennett, Lucas A Cernusak, Derek Eamus, Cacilia M Ewenz, Jordan P Goodrich, Mingkai Jiang, Nina Hinko-Najera, Peter Isaac, Sanaa Hobeichi, J\u00fcrgen Knauer, Georgia R Koerber, Michael Liddell, Xuanlong Ma, Craig Macfarlane, Ian D McHugh, Belinda E Medlyn, Wayne S Meyer, Alexander J Norton, Jyoteshna Owens, Andy Pitman, Elise Pendall, Suzanne M Prober, Ram L Ray, Natalia Restrepo-Coupe, Sami W Rifai, David Rowlings, Louis Schipper, Richard P Silberstein, Lina Teckentrup, Sally E Thompson, Anna M Ukkola, Aaron Wall, Ying-Ping Wang, Tim J Wardlaw, William Woodgate","title":"Bridge to the future: Important lessons from 20\u00a0years of ecosystem observations made by the OzFlux network.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"In 2020, the Australian and New Zealand flux research and monitoring network, OzFlux, celebrated its 20","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/35315565\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":205,"authors":"Alex Sen Gupta, Mads Thomsen, Jessica A Benthuysen, Alistair J Hobday, Eric Oliver, Lisa V Alexander, Michael T Burrows, Markus G Donat, Ming Feng, Neil J Holbrook, Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, Pippa J Moore, Regina R Rodrigues, Hillary A Scannell, Andr\u00e9a S Taschetto, Caroline C Ummenhofer, Thomas Wernberg, Dan A Smale","title":"Drivers and impacts of the most extreme marine heatwaves events.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Prolonged high-temperature extreme events in the ocean, marine heatwaves, can have severe and long-lasting impacts on marine ecosystems, fisheries and associated services. This study applies a marine heatwave framework to analyse a global sea surface temperature product and identify the most extreme events, based on their intensity, duration and spatial extent. Many of these events have yet to be described in terms of their physical attributes, generation mechanisms, or ecological impacts. Our synthesis identifies commonalities between marine heatwave characteristics and seasonality, links to the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, triggering processes and impacts on ocean productivity. The most intense events preferentially occur in summer, when climatological oceanic mixed layers are shallow and winds are weak, but at a time preceding climatological maximum sea surface temperatures. Most subtropical extreme marine heatwaves were triggered by persistent atmospheric high-pressure systems and anomalously weak wind speeds, associated with increased insolation, and reduced ocean heat losses. Furthermore, the most extreme events tended to coincide with reduced chlorophyll-a concentration at low and mid-latitudes. Understanding the importance of the oceanic background state, local and remote drivers and the ocean productivity response from past events are critical steps toward improving predictions of future marine heatwaves and their impacts.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/33168858\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":459,"authors":"IJ Dwyer, SJE Barry, I Megiddo, CJ White\u00a0- International journal of\u00a0\u2026, 2022 - Springer","title":"Evaluations of heat action plans for reducing the health impacts of extreme heat: methodological developments (2012\u20132021) and remaining challenges","predicted_label":1,"abstract":"\u2026 In this study, we collated evaluations of heat-health action plans that assessed their \neffectiveness in reducing the adverse health outcomes of hot weather extremes.

A better understanding of this variability is necessary for more accurate predictions of the future climate-carbon cycle feedback. Recent studies have suggested that variability in GPP is driven by a broad range of biotic and abiotic factors operating mainly through changes in vegetation phenology and physiological processes. However, it is still unclear how plant phenology and physiology can be integrated to explain the spatiotemporal variability of terrestrial GPP. Based on analyses of eddy-covariance and satellite-derived data, we decomposed annual terrestrial GPP into the length of the CO2 uptake period (CUP) and the seasonal maximal capacity of CO2 uptake (GPPmax). The product of CUP and GPPmax explained >90% of the temporal GPP variability in most areas of North America during 2000-2010 and the spatial GPP variation among globally distributed eddy flux tower sites. It also explained GPP response to the European heatwave in 2003 (r(2) = 0.90) and GPP recovery after a fire disturbance in South Dakota (r(2) = 0.88). Additional analysis of the eddy-covariance flux data shows that the interbiome variation in annual GPP is better explained by that in GPPmax than CUP. These findings indicate that terrestrial GPP is jointly controlled by ecosystem-level plant phenology and photosynthetic capacity, and greater understanding of GPPmax and CUP responses to environmental and biological variations will, thus, improve predictions of GPP over time and space.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/25730847\/","source":"pubmed"}],"Heatwaves Warning Systems other sources":"No"}

These areas are highly threatened by climate change-related factors as well as pollution, especially due to their limited water exchange. Ocean warming and extreme weather events, such as marine heatwaves and rainy periods, are some of the consequences of climate change, inducing alterations in the abiotic parameters of seawater, namely temperature and salinity, which may affect the organisms as well as the behaviour of some pollutants present in water. Lithium (Li) is an element widely used in several industries, especially in the production of batteries for electronic gadgets and electric vehicles. The demand for its exploitation has been growing drastically and is predicted a large increase in the coming years. Inefficient recycling, treatment and disposal results in the release of Li into the aquatic systems, the consequences of which are poorly understood, especially in the context of climate change. Considering that a limited number of studies exist about the impacts of Li on marine species, the present study aimed to assess the effects of temperature rise and salinity changes on the impacts of Li in clams (Venerupis corrugata) collected from the Ria de Aveiro (coastal lagoon, Portugal). Clams were exposed for 14 days to 0 \u03bcg\/L of Li and 200\u00a0\u03bcg\/L of Li, both conditions under different climate scenarios: 3 different salinities (20, 30 and 40) at 17\u00a0\u00b0C (control temperature); and 2 different temperatures (17 and 21\u00a0\u00b0C) at salinity 30 (control salinity). Bioconcentration capacity and biochemical alterations regarding metabolism and oxidative stress were investigated. Salinity variations had a higher impact on biochemical responses than temperature increase, even when combined with Li. The combination of Li with low salinity (20) was the most stressful treatment, provoking increased metabolism and activation of detoxification defences, suggesting possible imbalances in coastal ecosystems in response to Li pollution under extreme weather events. These findings may ultimately contribute to implement environmentally protective actions to mitigate Li contamination and preserve marine life.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/36906057\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":262,"authors":"L De Marchi, L R Vieira, L Intorre, V Meucci, F Battaglia, C Pretti, A M V M Soares, R Freitas","title":"Will extreme weather events influence the toxic impacts of caffeine in coastal systems?

The understanding of the combined effects of these extreme events and anthropogenic pollution is a vital challenge. In particular, the combined effect of MHWs on the toxicity of pharmaceuticals to aquatic life remains unclear. To contribute to these issues, the main goal of the present investigation was to evaluate how MHWs may increase caffeine (CAF) toxicity on the clam Ruditapes philippinarum and the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. Bioaccumulation levels and changes on oxidative stress, metabolic capacity and neurotoxic status related biomarkers were investigated. The obtained results revealed the absence of CAF accumulation in both species.

The increase of antioxidant defence mechanisms was complemented by an increase of metabolic activity and decrease of energy reserves.

Marine heatwaves (MHWs), occurring when seasonal temperature threshold is exceeded for at least 5 consecutive days, may reduce the tolerance of coastal species toward additional pressures, but interactions between such multiple stressors are virtually unexplored. The present study aimed to characterize in Mytilus galloprovincialis the influence of a simulated MHW scenario on the toxicological effects of the pharmaceutical carbamazepine (CBZ), ubiquitously detected in the marine environment and chosen as model compound for this relevant class of emerging contaminants. The bioaccumulation of CBZ and responsiveness of various biological parameters, including immune system, antioxidant status, lipid metabolism and cellular integrity, were analyzed in exposed mussels both during and after the end of the heatwave. MHW appeared to strongly modulate accumulation of CBZ, paralleled by weakened immunocompetence and onset of oxidative disturbance that finally evolved to cellular damages and lipid metabolism disorders. Elaboration of the overall results through a quantitative Weight of Evidence model, revealed the highest hazard in organisms exposed to both the stressors 10 days after the end of the heatwave, suggesting that MHWs could leave a footprint on the capability of mussels to counteract CBZ toxicity, thus affecting their vulnerability and predisposition to adverse effects toward multiple stressors.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/35143899\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":264,"authors":"Diana Madeira, Joana Filipa Fernandes, Daniel Jer\u00f3nimo, Patr\u00edcia Martins, Fernando Ricardo, Andreia Santos, Maria Ros\u00e1rio Domingues, M\u00e1rio Sousa Diniz, Ricardo Calado","title":"Salinity shapes the stress responses and energy reserves of marine polychaetes exposed to warming: From molecular to functional phenotypes.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Estuarine systems are critical transition zones influenced by sea, land and freshwater. An array of human activities impacts these areas leading to multiple-stressor interactions. Temperature and salinity are among the most relevant drivers in estuaries, shaping species growth, reproduction and distribution. However, few studies provide an overview of cellular rewiring processes under multiple-stressor environments. Here, we tested how salinity could shape the response of ragworms Hediste diversicolor, an important bioindicator and commercial species, to elevated temperature. We exposed polychaetes to three temperatures for a month, simulating control, ocean warming and heatwave conditions (24, 27 and 30 \u00b0C, respectively) combined with two salinities (20 and 30). We quantified whole-organism performance (wet weight gain and survival), along with cellular stress response (CSR) and energy reserves of worms after 14 and 28 days of exposure. Significant three-way interactions between temperature, salinity and exposure time show the non-linearity of molecular responses. Worms at a salinity of 20 were more sensitive to warming than worms exposed to a salinity of 30. The combination of high temperature and low salinity can act synergistically to induce oxidative stress and macromolecular damage in worm tissues. This finding was supported by an induction of the CSR, with a concomitant decrease of energy reserves, pointing towards a metabolic compensation strategy. However, under a higher salinity (30), the need for a CSR upon thermal challenge was reduced and energy content increased with temperature, which suggests that environmental conditions were within the optimum range. Heatwaves striking low-salinity areas of estuaries can therefore negatively impact the cellular physiology of H. diversicolor, with greater metabolic costs. However, extreme stress levels were not reached as worms incremented wet weight and survival was high under all conditions tested. Our findings are important for the optimization of ragworm aquaculture and adaptive conservation strategies of estuarine systems.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/34246144\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":265,"authors":"A Leite, A J Santos, S Silva, B Nunes, R Mexia, A P Rodrigues","title":"Assessing the use and understanding of the Portuguese heat-health warning system (\u00cdCARO).","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Heatwaves can lead to increased mortality.

The new system has important advantages such as: rapid information acquisition, completeness (the entire population is included), lightness (very little information is exchanged, date of death, age, sex, place of death registration). It allows rapid detection of impacts (within five days) and allows a quick preliminary quantification of impacts that usually took several years to be done.

It involves technical development and economic, social, and environmental objectives. In response to the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) and global trends, Korea has prepared legal and institutional measures for smart city composition. This study reviewed the importance of key documents and agreements in Daegu Metropolitan City to reduce disaster risk for the vulnerable in the context of smart cities. 25 research studies were critically and systematically reviewed from the perspective of disaster risk reduction in smart cities. In its disaster safety areas, Daegu Metropolitan City aims to reduce property damage and casualties that may occur because of physical events such as collapse, water-related disasters, and heatwaves by up to 20%. Smart disaster mitigation involves data collection, sharing, and propagation. The entire process is handled on a safety platform called Data hub. According to the Daegu Metropolitan City government, solving social problems and managing disasters is key to a smart city, and it is striving to improve the efficiency of other cities. However, Daegu has limitations because it is a service-oriented smart city, and it is necessary to engage citizens to participate, raise awareness of the smart city, and educate them on the platform.

The level of heatwave warning is normally determined by using the threshold temperature of heat-related morbidity or mortality. However, morbidity and mortality threshold temperatures have not been used together to account for the severity of health impacts. In this study, we developed a heatwave warning system with two different warning levels: Level-1 and Level-2, by analyzing the severity and likelihood of heat-related morbidity and mortality using the generalized additive model. The study particularly focuses on the cases in Seoul, South Korea, between 2011 and 2018. The study found that the threshold temperature for heat-related morbidity and mortality are 30 \u00b0C and 33 \u00b0C, respectively. Approximately 73.1% of heat-related patients visited hospitals when temperature was between 30 \u00b0C and 33 \u00b0C. We validated the developed HWWS by using both the threshold temperatures of morbidity and mortality. The area under curves (AUCs) of the proposed model were 0.74 and 0.86 at Level-1 and Level-2, respectively. On the other hand, the AUCs of the model using only the mortality threshold were 0.60 and 0.86 at Level-1 and Level-2, respectively. The AUCs of the model using only the morbidity threshold were 0.73 and 0.78 at Level-1 and Level-2, respectively. The results suggest that the updated HWWS can help to reduce the impact of heatwaves, particularly on vulnerable groups, by providing the customized information. This also indicates that the HWWS could effectively mitigate the risk of morbidity and mortality.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/33804431\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":513,"authors":"Y Chae, J Park\u00a0- \u2026\u00a0Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 2021 - mdpi.com","title":"Analysis on effectiveness of impact based heatwave warning considering severity and likelihood of health impacts in Seoul, Korea","predicted_label":1,"abstract":"\u2026 Some studies have shown that excess mortality from heat waves in London increased \ndramatically at about 19 C [30,31].

It is categorized as classic when it results from passive exposure to extreme environmental heat and as exertional when it develops during strenuous exercise.

These health effects are related to not only the physical phenomenon of heat itself but other characteristics such as frequency, intensity, and duration of heatwaves. Therefore, understanding heatwave characteristics is a crucial step in the development of heat-health warning systems (HHWS) that could prevent or reduce negative heat-related health outcomes. However, there are no South African studies that have quantified heatwaves with a threshold that incorporated a temperature metric based on a health outcome. To fill this gap, this study aimed to assess the spatial and temporal distribution and frequency of past (2014 - 2019) and future (period 2020 - 2039) heatwaves across South Africa. Heatwaves were defined using a threshold for diurnal temperature range (DTR) that was found to have measurable impacts on mortality. In the current climate, inland provinces experienced fewer heatwaves of longer duration and greater intensity compared to coastal provinces that experienced heatwaves of lower intensity. The highest frequency of heatwaves occurred during the austral summer accounting for a total of 150 events out of 270 from 2014 to 2019. The heatwave definition applied in this study also identified severe heatwaves across the country during late 2015 to early 2016 which was during the strongest El Ni\u00f1o event ever recorded to date. Record-breaking global temperatures were reported during this period; the North West province in South Africa was the worst affected experiencing heatwaves ranging from 12 to 77\u00a0days. Future climate analysis showed increasing trends in heatwave events with the greatest increases (80%-87%) expected to occur during summer months. The number of heatwaves occurring in cooler seasons is expected to increase with more events projected from the winter months of July and August, onwards. The findings of this study show that the identification of provinces and towns that experience intense, long-lasting heatwaves is crucial to inform development and implementation of targeted heat-health adaptation strategies. These findings could also guide authorities to prioritise vulnerable population groups such as the elderly and children living in high-risk areas likely to be affected by heatwaves.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/36401226\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":289,"authors":"Luxon Nhamo, Lameck Rwizi, Sylvester Mpandeli, Joel Botai, James Magidi, Henerica Tazvinga, Nafiisa Sobratee, Stanley Liphadzi, Dhesigen Naidoo, Albert T Modi, Rob Slotow, Tafadzwanashe Mabhaudhi","title":"Urban nexus and transformative pathways towards resilient cities: A case of the Gauteng City-Region, South Africa.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Challenges emanating from rapid urbanisation require innovative strategies to transform cities into global climate action and adaptation centres.

MHW-induced coral bleaching events have been observed frequently in recent decades in the southeast Indian Ocean (SEIO), a region traditionally regarded to have resilience to global warming. In this study, we assess the contribution of El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) to MHWs across the mostly understudied reefs in the SEIO. We find that in extended summer months, the MHWs at tropical and subtropical reefs (divided at ~20\u00b0S) are driven by opposite ENSO polarities: MHWs are more likely to occur at the tropical reefs during eastern Pacific El Ni\u00f1o, driven by enhanced solar radiation and weaker Australian Monsoon, some likely alleviated by positive Indian Ocean Dipole events, and at the subtropical reefs during central Pacific La Ni\u00f1a, mainly caused by increased horizontal heat transport, and in some cases reinforced by local air-sea interactions. Madden-Julian Oscillations (MJO) also modulate the MHW occurrences. Projected future increases in ENSO and MJO intensity with greenhouse warming will enhance thermal stress across the SEIO.

We applied distributed lag non-linear models in an individual-level case-crossover design to assess the effects of heat on mortality in Switzerland during the warm season from 2003 to 2016 for three temperature metrics (daily mean, maximum, and minimum temperature), and various threshold temperatures and heatwave definitions. Individual death records with information on residential address from the Swiss National Cohort were linked to high-resolution temperature estimates from 100 m resolution maps. Moderate (90th percentile) to extreme thresholds (99.5th percentile) of the three temperature metrics implied a significant increase in mortality (5 to 38%) in respect of the median warm-season temperature. Effects of the threshold temperatures on mortality were similar across the seven major regions in Switzerland. Heatwave duration did not modify the effect when considering delayed effects up to 7 days.

Our synthesis identifies commonalities between marine heatwave characteristics and seasonality, links to the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, triggering processes and impacts on ocean productivity. The most intense events preferentially occur in summer, when climatological oceanic mixed layers are shallow and winds are weak, but at a time preceding climatological maximum sea surface temperatures. Most subtropical extreme marine heatwaves were triggered by persistent atmospheric high-pressure systems and anomalously weak wind speeds, associated with increased insolation, and reduced ocean heat losses. Furthermore, the most extreme events tended to coincide with reduced chlorophyll-a concentration at low and mid-latitudes. Understanding the importance of the oceanic background state, local and remote drivers and the ocean productivity response from past events are critical steps toward improving predictions of future marine heatwaves and their impacts.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/33168858\/","source":"pubmed"}],"Heatwaves Warning Systems other sources":"No"}

Coastal zones are some of the most productive and vulnerable ecosystems, with many stretches already under anthropogenic pressure. Microorganisms in coastal areas are central to marine energy and nutrient cycling and therefore, it is important to understand how climate change will alter these ecosystems. Using a long-term heated bay (warmed for 50 years) in comparison with an unaffected adjacent control bay and an experimental short-term thermal (9 days at 6-35\u2009\u00b0C) incubation experiment, this study provides new insights into how coastal benthic water and surface sediment bacterial communities respond to temperature change. Benthic bacterial communities in the two bays reacted differently to temperature increases with productivity in the heated bay having a broader thermal tolerance compared with that in the control bay. Furthermore, the transcriptional analysis showed that the heated bay benthic bacteria had higher transcript numbers related to energy metabolism and stress compared to the control bay, while short-term elevated temperatures in the control bay incubation experiment induced a transcript response resembling that observed in the heated bay field conditions. In contrast, a reciprocal response was not observed for the heated bay community RNA transcripts exposed to lower temperatures indicating a potential tipping point in community response may have been reached. In summary, long-term warming modulates the performance, productivity, and resilience of bacterial communities in response to warming.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/36977742\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":347,"authors":"Chloe Brimicombe, Chun Hay Brian Lo, Florian Pappenberger, Claudia Di Napoli, Pedro Maciel, Tiago Quintino, Rosalind Cornforth, Hannah L Cloke","title":"Wet Bulb Globe Temperature: Indicating Extreme Heat Risk on a Global Grid.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"The Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) is an international standard heat index used by the health, industrial, sports, and climate sectors to assess thermal comfort during heat extremes.

Over the last 20\u00a0years, three major coral bleaching events occurred in concomitance with anomalous heatwaves, provoking a severe loss of coral cover worldwide. The conservation strategies for preserving reefs, as they are implemented now, cannot cope with global climatic shifts. Consequently, researchers are advocating for preservation networks to be set-up to reinforce coral adaptive potential. However, the main obstacle to this implementation is that studies on coral adaption are usually hard to generalize at the scale of a reef system. Here, we study the relationships between genotype frequencies and environmental characteristics of the sea (seascape genomics), in combination with connectivity analysis, to investigate the adaptive potential of a flagship coral species of the Ryukyu Archipelago (Japan). By associating genotype frequencies with descriptors of historical environmental conditions, we discovered six genomic regions hosting polymorphisms that might promote resistance against heat stress. Remarkably, annotations of genes in these regions were consistent with molecular roles associated with heat responses. Furthermore, we combined information on genetic and spatial distances between reefs to predict connectivity at a regional scale. The combination of these results portrayed the adaptive potential of this population: we were able to identify reefs carrying potential heat stress adapted genotypes and to understand how they disperse to neighbouring reefs. This information was summarized by objective, quantifiable and mappable indices covering the whole region, which can be extremely useful for future prioritization of reefs in conservation planning. This framework is transferable to any coral species on any reef system and therefore represents a valuable tool for empowering preservation efforts dedicated to the protection of coral reefs in warming oceans.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/32908595\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":332,"authors":"Mana Gharun, Lukas H\u00f6rtnagl, Eug\u00e9nie Paul-Limoges, Shiva Ghiasi, Iris Feigenwinter, Susanne Burri, Kristiina Marquardt, Sophia Etzold, Roman Zweifel, Werner Eugster, Nina Buchmann","title":"Physiological response of Swiss ecosystems to 2018 drought across plant types and elevation.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Using five eddy covariance flux sites (two forests and three grasslands), we investigated ecosystem physiological responses to the 2018 drought across elevational gradients in Switzerland. Flux measurements showed that at lower elevation sites (below 1000 m.a.s.l.; grassland and mixed forest) annual ecosystem productivity (GPP) declined by approximately 20% compared to the previous 2 years (2016 and 2017), which led to a reduced annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP). At the high elevation sites, however, GPP increased by approximately 14% and as a result NEP increased in the alpine and montane grasslands, but not in the subalpine coniferous forest. There, increased ecosystem respiration led to a reduced annual NEP, despite increased GPP and lengthening of the growing period. Among all ecosystems, the coniferous forest showed the most pronounced negative stomatal response to atmospheric dryness (i.e. vapour pressure deficit, VPD) that resulted in a decline in surface conductance and an increased water-use efficiency during drought. While increased temperature enhanced the water-use efficiency of both forests, de-coupling of GPP from evapotranspiration at the low-elevation grassland site negatively affected water-use efficiency due to non-stomatal reductions in photosynthesis. Our results show that hot droughts (such as in 2018) lead to different responses across plants types, and thus ecosystems. Particularly grasslands at lower elevations are the most vulnerable ecosystems to negative impacts of future drought in Switzerland.

Our results underscore the additional challenges from MHWs for fisheries and their management under climate change.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/32317685\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":335,"authors":"Martina S Ragettli, Martin R\u00f6\u00f6sli","title":"[Heat-health action plans to prevent heat-related deaths-experiences from Switzerland].","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Since the record-breaking temperatures registered during summer 2003, cantonal health authorities in Switzerland have implemented measures to prevent adverse health effects from hot weather and heatwaves. Six cantons in the west of Switzerland and the canton of Ticino have developed heat-health action plans. Such plans integrate and coordinate the actions at different levels among predefined partners. Measures include the communication of health risks, alert systems, and special actions during heatwaves.This report provides an overview of health strategies and analyses of heat-related mortality in Switzerland between 2004 and 2015. Analyses show that heat-health action plans have contributed to the prevention of heat-related deaths after 2003 and during the 2015 heatwave in the warmest regions of Switzerland. However, protecting public health during periods of extreme heat still remains a\u00a0challenge. The effectiveness of the various measures that have been implemented in the cantons is still not fully understood.The projects aimed at evaluating the health impacts of heat have contributed to raising the awareness of heat-related health risks among cantonal policy makers as well as in the general population in Switzerland.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/30899963\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":336,"authors":"Meili Feng, Guido Zolezzi, Martin Pusch","title":"Effects of thermopeaking on the thermal response of alpine river systems to heatwaves.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Within the past 30years there have been two major heatwave events (in 2003 and 2006) that broke 500-year-old temperature records in Europe. Owing to the growing concern of rising temperatures, we analyzed the potential response in a number of river sections that are subject to hydropeaking and thermopeaking through the intermittent release of water from hydropower stations. Thermopeaking in alpine streams is known to intermittently cool down the river water in summer and to warm it up in winter. We analyzed the response of river water temperature to air temperature during heatwaves at 19 gauging stations across Switzerland, using a 30-yr dataset at a 10-min resolution. Stations were either classified into \"unpeaked\" or \"peaked\" groups according to four statistical indicators related to hydropeaking and thermopeaking pressure. Peaked stations were exposed to reduced temporal variability in river water temperature, and it was determined that correlations between river water and air temperature were weaker for peaked stations compared with unpeaked stations. Similarly, peaked stations showed a much weaker response to heatwaves compared with unpeaked stations. It is important to note that this \"cooling effect\" created by hydro-thermopeaking was most pronounced during the two major heatwave events that took place in 2003 and 2006. Furthermore, results from thermal stress events on the growth of a typical cold eurythermic fish species (brown trout) increased continuously in rivers subject to peaked station water release during heatwaves. While hydropower operations that take place high up on mountains releasing hypolimnetic water may mitigate the adverse effects of heatwaves on downstream alpine river ecosystems locally, our results show the complexity of an artificial physical template associated with flow regime regulation in alpine streams.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/28898932\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":337,"authors":"Jianyang Xia, Shuli Niu, Philippe Ciais, Ivan A Janssens, Jiquan Chen, Christof Ammann, Altaf Arain, Peter D Blanken, Alessandro Cescatti, Damien Bonal, Nina Buchmann, Peter S Curtis, Shiping Chen, Jinwei Dong, Lawrence B Flanagan, Christian Frankenberg, Teodoro Georgiadis, Christopher M Gough, Dafeng Hui, Gerard Kiely, Jianwei Li, Magnus Lund, Vincenzo Magliulo, Barbara Marcolla, Lutz Merbold, Leonardo Montagnani, Eddy J Moors, J\u00f8rgen E Olesen, Shilong Piao, Antonio Raschi, Olivier Roupsard, Andrew E Suyker, Marek Urbaniak, Francesco P Vaccari, Andrej Varlagin, Timo Vesala, Matthew Wilkinson, Ensheng Weng, Georg Wohlfahrt, Liming Yan, Yiqi Luo","title":"Joint control of terrestrial gross primary productivity by plant phenology and physiology.","predicted_label":"0","abstract":"Terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) varies greatly over time and space. A better understanding of this variability is necessary for more accurate predictions of the future climate-carbon cycle feedback. Recent studies have suggested that variability in GPP is driven by a broad range of biotic and abiotic factors operating mainly through changes in vegetation phenology and physiological processes. However, it is still unclear how plant phenology and physiology can be integrated to explain the spatiotemporal variability of terrestrial GPP. Based on analyses of eddy-covariance and satellite-derived data, we decomposed annual terrestrial GPP into the length of the CO2 uptake period (CUP) and the seasonal maximal capacity of CO2 uptake (GPPmax). The product of CUP and GPPmax explained >90% of the temporal GPP variability in most areas of North America during 2000-2010 and the spatial GPP variation among globally distributed eddy flux tower sites. It also explained GPP response to the European heatwave in 2003 (r(2) = 0.90) and GPP recovery after a fire disturbance in South Dakota (r(2) = 0.88). Additional analysis of the eddy-covariance flux data shows that the interbiome variation in annual GPP is better explained by that in GPPmax than CUP. These findings indicate that terrestrial GPP is jointly controlled by ecosystem-level plant phenology and photosynthetic capacity, and greater understanding of GPPmax and CUP responses to environmental and biological variations will, thus, improve predictions of GPP over time and space.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/25730847\/","source":"pubmed"}],"Heatwaves Warning Systems other sources":"No"}

Multiple sources of information limit potential data bias and avoid misclassification. Using a temperate kelp forest fish community in California, USA as a test case for this new methodology, we found the majority of species had high classification agreement across all four data sources (n = 78) but also a number of low agreement species (2 sources disagree from the others, n = 47). For species with low agreement, use of just one dataset to classify species, as is commonly done, would lead to high risk of misclassification. Differences in species classification between individual datasets and our composite classification were apparent. Applying different thermal classifications, lead to different conclusions when quantifying 'warm' and 'cool' species density responses to a marine heatwave.

Across the time series, we observed an increase in the abundance of Prochlorococcus relative to Synechococcus as well as elevated frequencies of ecotypes commonly associated with low-nutrient and high-temperature conditions. The relationships between environmental and ecotype trends appeared to operate on differing temporal scales. In contrast to ecotype trends, most microdiverse populations were static and possibly reflect local habitat conditions.

Most birds were severely emaciated and, so far, no evidence for anything other than starvation was found to explain this mass mortality. Three-quarters of murres were found in the Gulf of Alaska and the remainder along the West Coast. Studies show that only a fraction of birds that die at sea typically wash ashore, and we estimate that total mortality approached 1 million birds. About two-thirds of murres killed were adults, a substantial blow to breeding populations. Additionally, 22 complete reproductive failures were observed at multiple colonies region-wide during (2015) and after (2016-2017) the mass mortality event. Die-offs and breeding failures occur sporadically in murres, but the magnitude, duration and spatial extent of this die-off, associated with multi-colony and multi-year reproductive failures, is unprecedented and astonishing. These events co-occurred with the most powerful marine heatwave on record that persisted through 2014-2016 and created an enormous volume of ocean water (the \"Blob\") from California to Alaska with temperatures that exceeded average by 2-3 standard deviations. Other studies indicate that this prolonged heatwave reduced phytoplankton biomass and restructured zooplankton communities in favor of lower-calorie species, while it simultaneously increased metabolically driven food demands of ectothermic forage fish. In response, forage fish quality and quantity diminished. Similarly, large ectothermic groundfish were thought to have increased their demand for forage fish, resulting in greater top-predator demands for diminished forage fish resources. We hypothesize that these bottom-up and top-down forces created an \"ectothermic vise\" on forage species leading to their system-wide scarcity and resulting in mass mortality of murres and many other fish, bird and mammal species in the region during 2014-2017.","link":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/31940310\/","source":"pubmed"},{"id":509,"authors":null,"title":null,"predicted_label":0,"abstract":null,"link":"https:\/\/toolkit.climate.gov\/case-studies\/developing-early-warning-system-prevent-heat-illness&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwim9dau0NSBAxV4r5UCHWdHBvgQFnoECAYQAg&amp;usg=AOvVaw2mL_h9Q4FYWJGPB-l2LEL2\"","source":"google_scholar"}],"Heatwaves Warning Systems other sources":"No"}
