Ireland,Preventative strategies and interventions to improve outcomes during heatwaves.,"Michelle Brennan, Paula M O'Shea, Eamon C Mulkerrin","Extreme weather events including recently experienced prolonged heatwaves are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity as a result of climate change. Vulnerable groups, and particularly older persons, are at increased risk of heat-related illness and mortality. Multimodal interventions that incorporate community, primary and secondary care programmes are required. Social programmes such as early warning systems, regional heat plans and community-led initiatives that specifically target the isolated, dependent older person are protective. Establishing clear and effective communication on health promotion and preventative measures is the key. Energy-efficient building design and eco-city planning are vital to reduce the impact of heatwaves at both a population and individual level. Anticipatory strategies should be adopted to ensure ample access to fluids, target barriers to increase oral intake and allow early identification of intercurrent illness, along with regular medication reviews. Prompt management of risk factors for the development of heat-related illness and treatment of complications such as heat stroke and cardiovascular events are keys to reducing the negative health impact of extreme heat in at-risk populations. Morbidity and mortality in heatwaves should be preventable. Evidence-based interventions are available to mitigate and prevent the negative health impact of extreme heat and should be implemented in all residential settings."

United States of America,Extreme Heat and Adverse Cardiovascular Outcomes in Australia and New Zealand: What Do We Know?,"Georgia K Chaseling, Nathan B Morris, Nicholas Ravanelli","Extreme heat events are a leading natural hazard risk to human health. Under all future climate change models, extreme heat events will continue to increase in frequency, duration, and intensity. Evidence from previous extreme heat events across the globe demonstrates that adverse cardiovascular events are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly amongst the elderly and those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. However, less is understood about the adverse effects of extreme heat amongst specific cardiovascular diseases (i.e., heart failure, dysrhythmias) and demographics (sex, ethnicity, age) within Australia and New Zealand. Furthermore, although Australia has implemented regional and state heat warning systems, most personal heat-health protective advice available in public health policy documents is either insufficient, not grounded in scientific evidence, and/or does not consider clinical factors such as age or co-morbidities. Dissemination of evidence-based recommendations and enhancing community resilience to extreme heat disasters within Australia and New Zealand should be an area of critical focus to reduce the burden and negative health effects associated with extreme heat. This narrative review will focus on five key areas in relation to extreme heat events within Australia and New Zealand: 1) the potential physiological mechanisms that cause adverse cardiovascular outcomes during extreme heat events; 2) how big is the problem within Australia and New Zealand?; 3) what the heat-health response plans are; 4) research knowledge and translation; and, 5) knowledge gaps and areas for future research."

Thailand,"Excess seawater nutrients, enlarged algal symbiont densities and bleaching sensitive reef locations: 2. A regional-scale predictive model for the Great Barrier Reef, Australia.","Scott A Wooldridge, Scott F Heron, Jon E Brodie, Terence J Done, Itsara Masiri, Saskia Hinrichs","A spatial risk assessment model is developed for the Great Barrier Reef (GBR, Australia) that helps identify reef locations at higher or lower risk of coral bleaching in summer heat-wave conditions. The model confirms the considerable benefit of discriminating nutrient-enriched areas that contain corals with enlarged (suboptimal) symbiont densities for the purpose of identifying bleaching-sensitive reef locations. The benefit of the new system-level understanding is showcased in terms of: (i) improving early-warning forecasts of summer bleaching risk, (ii) explaining historical bleaching patterns, (iii) testing the bleaching-resistant quality of the current marine protected area (MPA) network (iv) identifying routinely monitored coral health attributes, such as the tissue energy reserves and skeletal growth characteristics (viz. density and extension rates) that correlate with bleaching resistant reef locations, and (v) targeting region-specific water quality improvement strategies that may increase reef-scale coral health and bleaching resistance."

Relationships between cardiovascular health and meteorological conditions are usually studied based on specific meteorological events or means. However, those studies bring little to no insight into health peaks and unusual events far from the mean, such as a day with an unusually high number of hospitalizations. Health peaks represent a heavy burden for the public health system; they are, however, usually studied specifically when they occur (e.g., the European 2003 heatwave). Specific analyses are needed, using appropriate statistical tools. Quantile regression can provide such analysis by focusing not only on the conditional median, but on different conditional quantiles of the dependent variable. In particular, high quantiles of a health issue can be treated as health peaks. In this study, quantile regression is used to model the relationships between conditional quantiles of cardiovascular variables and meteorological variables in Montreal (Canada), focusing on health peaks. Results show that meteorological impacts are not constant throughout the conditional quantiles. They are stronger in health peaks compared to quantiles around the median. Results also show that temperature is the main significant variable. This study highlights the fact that classical statistical methods are not appropriate when health peaks are of interest. Quantile regression allows for more precise estimations for health peaks, which could lead to refined public health warnings."

Evidence from previous extreme heat events across the globe demonstrates that adverse cardiovascular events are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly amongst the elderly and those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. However, less is understood about the adverse effects of extreme heat amongst specific cardiovascular diseases (i.e., heart failure, dysrhythmias) and demographics (sex, ethnicity, age) within Australia and New Zealand. Furthermore, although Australia has implemented regional and state heat warning systems, most personal heat-health protective advice available in public health policy documents is either insufficient, not grounded in scientific evidence, and/or does not consider clinical factors such as age or co-morbidities. Dissemination of evidence-based recommendations and enhancing community resilience to extreme heat disasters within Australia and New Zealand should be an area of critical focus to reduce the burden and negative health effects associated with extreme heat. This narrative review will focus on five key areas in relation to extreme heat events within Australia and New Zealand: 1) the potential physiological mechanisms that cause adverse cardiovascular outcomes during extreme heat events; 2) how big is the problem within Australia and New Zealand?; 3) what the heat-health response plans are; 4) research knowledge and translation; and, 5) knowledge gaps and areas for future research."
Canada,Cardiovascular Health Peaks and Meteorological Conditions: A Quantile Regression Approach.,"Yohann Moanahere Chiu, Fateh Chebana, Belkacem Abdous, Diane Bélanger, Pierre Gosselin","Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are influenced by meteorological conditions, such as temperature or snowfall. Relationships between cardiovascular health and meteorological conditions are usually studied based on specific meteorological events or means. However, those studies bring little to no insight into health peaks and unusual events far from the mean, such as a day with an unusually high number of hospitalizations. Health peaks represent a heavy burden for the public health system; they are, however, usually studied specifically when they occur (e.g., the European 2003 heatwave). Specific analyses are needed, using appropriate statistical tools. Quantile regression can provide such analysis by focusing not only on the conditional median, but on different conditional quantiles of the dependent variable. In particular, high quantiles of a health issue can be treated as health peaks. In this study, quantile regression is used to model the relationships between conditional quantiles of cardiovascular variables and meteorological variables in Montreal (Canada), focusing on health peaks. Results show that meteorological impacts are not constant throughout the conditional quantiles. They are stronger in health peaks compared to quantiles around the median. Results also show that temperature is the main significant variable. This study highlights the fact that classical statistical methods are not appropriate when health peaks are of interest. Quantile regression allows for more precise estimations for health peaks, which could lead to refined public health warnings."

Germany,Towards a Generic Residential Building Model for Heat-Health Warning Systems.,"Jens Pfafferott, Sascha Rißmann, Guido Halbig, Franz Schröder, Sascha Saad","A strong heat load in buildings and cities during the summer is not a new phenomenon. However, prolonged heat waves and increasing urbanization are intensifying the heat island effect in our cities; hence, the heat exposure in residential buildings. The thermophysiological load in the interior and exterior environments can be reduced in the medium and long term, through urban planning and building physics measures. In the short term, an increasingly vulnerable population must be effectively informed of an impending heat wave. Building simulation models can be favorably used to evaluate indoor heat stress. This study presents a generic simulation model, developed from monitoring data in urban multi-unit residential buildings during a summer period and using statistical methods. The model determines both the average room temperature and its deviations and, thus, consists of three sub-models: cool, average, and warm building types. The simulation model is based on the same mathematical algorithm, whereas each building type is described by a specific data set, concerning its building physical parameters and user behavior, respectively. The generic building model may be used in urban climate analyses with many individual buildings distributed across the city or in heat-health warning systems, with different building and user types distributed across a region. An urban climate analysis (with weather data from a database) may evaluate local differences in urban and indoor climate, whereas heat-health warning systems (driven by a weather forecast) obtain additional information on indoor heat stress and its expected deviations."

Large areas of the country are affected, particularly urban settlements, where about 77% of the population lives, which are exposed to multiple inner-city threats, such as urban heat islands. Because harm to public health is directly released by high ambient air temperatures, local and national studies on heat-related morbidity and mortality indicate that vulnerable groups such as the elderly population are predominantly threatened with heat-related health problems. After the severe mortality impacts of the extreme summer heat 2003 in Europe, in 2008, Germany took up the National Adaptation Strategy on Climate Change to tackle and manage the impacts of weather extremes, for example to protect people's health against heat. Public health systems and services need to be better prepared to improve resilience to the effects of extreme heat events, e.g., by implementing heat health action plans.

Germany,Effects of ventilation behaviour on indoor heat load based on test reference years.,"Madeleine Rosenfelder, Christina Koppe, Jens Pfafferott, Andreas Matzarakis","Since 2003, most European countries established heat health warning systems to alert the population to heat load. Heat health warning systems are based on predicted meteorological conditions outdoors. But the majority of the European population spends a substantial amount of time indoors, and indoor thermal conditions can differ substantially from outdoor conditions. The German Meteorological Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst, DWD) extended the existing heat health warning system (HHWS) with a thermal building simulation model to consider heat load indoors. In this study, the thermal building simulation model is used to simulate a standardized building representing a modern nursing home, because elderly and sick people are most sensitive to heat stress. Different types of natural ventilation were simulated. Based on current and future test reference years, changes in the future heat load indoors were analyzed. Results show differences between the various ventilation options and the possibility to minimize the thermal heat stress during summer by using an appropriate ventilation method. Nighttime ventilation for indoor thermal comfort is most important. A fully opened window at nighttime and the 2-h ventilation in the morning and evening are more sufficient to avoid heat stress than a tilted window at nighttime and the 1-h ventilation in the morning and the evening. Especially the ventilation in the morning seems to be effective to keep the heat load indoors low. Comparing the results for the current and the future test reference years, an increase of heat stress on all ventilation types can be recognized."

Large areas of the country are affected, particularly urban settlements, where about 77% of the population lives, which are exposed to multiple inner-city threats, such as urban heat islands. Because harm to public health is directly released by high ambient air temperatures, local and national studies on heat-related morbidity and mortality indicate that vulnerable groups such as the elderly population are predominantly threatened with heat-related health problems. After the severe mortality impacts of the extreme summer heat 2003 in Europe, in 2008, Germany took up the National Adaptation Strategy on Climate Change to tackle and manage the impacts of weather extremes, for example to protect people's health against heat.

Germany,Effects of ventilation behaviour on indoor heat load based on test reference years.,"Madeleine Rosenfelder, Christina Koppe, Jens Pfafferott, Andreas Matzarakis","Since 2003, most European countries established heat health warning systems to alert the population to heat load. Heat health warning systems are based on predicted meteorological conditions outdoors. But the majority of the European population spends a substantial amount of time indoors, and indoor thermal conditions can differ substantially from outdoor conditions. The German Meteorological Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst, DWD) extended the existing heat health warning system (HHWS) with a thermal building simulation model to consider heat load indoors. In this study, the thermal building simulation model is used to simulate a standardized building representing a modern nursing home, because elderly and sick people are most sensitive to heat stress. Different types of natural ventilation were simulated. Based on current and future test reference years, changes in the future heat load indoors were analyzed. Results show differences between the various ventilation options and the possibility to minimize the thermal heat stress during summer by using an appropriate ventilation method. Nighttime ventilation for indoor thermal comfort is most important. A fully opened window at nighttime and the 2-h ventilation in the morning and evening are more sufficient to avoid heat stress than a tilted window at nighttime and the 1-h ventilation in the morning and the evening. Especially the ventilation in the morning seems to be effective to keep the heat load indoors low. Comparing the results for the current and the future test reference years, an increase of heat stress on all ventilation types can be recognized."

This essay focuses on unusual extreme summer heat extremes occurring in Germany at higher frequency, longer duration, and with new temperature records. Large areas of the country are affected, particularly urban settlements, where about 77% of the population lives, which are exposed to multiple inner-city threats, such as urban heat islands. Because harm to public health is directly released by high ambient air temperatures, local and national studies on heat-related morbidity and mortality indicate that vulnerable groups such as the elderly population are predominantly threatened with heat-related health problems. After the severe mortality impacts of the extreme summer heat 2003 in Europe, in 2008, Germany took up the National Adaptation Strategy on Climate Change to tackle and manage the impacts of weather extremes, for example to protect people's health against heat. Public health systems and services need to be better prepared to improve resilience to the effects of extreme heat events, e.g., by implementing heat health action plans. Both climate protection as well as adaptation are necessary in order to be able to respond as adequate as possible to the challenges posed by climate change."

Germany,Effects of ventilation behaviour on indoor heat load based on test reference years.,"Madeleine Rosenfelder, Christina Koppe, Jens Pfafferott, Andreas Matzarakis","Since 2003, most European countries established heat health warning systems to alert the population to heat load. Heat health warning systems are based on predicted meteorological conditions outdoors. But the majority of the European population spends a substantial amount of time indoors, and indoor thermal conditions can differ substantially from outdoor conditions. The German Meteorological Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst, DWD) extended the existing heat health warning system (HHWS) with a thermal building simulation model to consider heat load indoors. In this study, the thermal building simulation model is used to simulate a standardized building representing a modern nursing home, because elderly and sick people are most sensitive to heat stress. Different types of natural ventilation were simulated. Based on current and future test reference years, changes in the future heat load indoors were analyzed. Results show differences between the various ventilation options and the possibility to minimize the thermal heat stress during summer by using an appropriate ventilation method. Nighttime ventilation for indoor thermal comfort is most important. A fully opened window at nighttime and the 2-h ventilation in the morning and evening are more sufficient to avoid heat stress than a tilted window at nighttime and the 1-h ventilation in the morning and the evening. Especially the ventilation in the morning seems to be effective to keep the heat load indoors low. Comparing the results for the current and the future test reference years, an increase of heat stress on all ventilation types can be recognized."

However, human health and performance are affected at much lower environmental heat strain levels than those directly associated with higher mortality. Moreover, workers are at elevated health risks when exposed to prolonged heat. This study describes the multilingual ""HEAT-SHIELD occupational warning system"" platform (https://heatshield.zonalab.it/) operating for Europe and developed within the framework of the HEAT-SHIELD project. This system is based on probabilistic medium-range forecasts calibrated on approximately 1800 meteorological stations in Europe and provides the ensemble forecast of the daily maximum heat stress. The platform provides a non-customized output represented by a map showing the weekly maximum probability of exceeding a specific heat stress condition, for each of the four upcoming weeks. Customized output allows the forecast of the personalized local heat-stress-risk based on workers' physical, clothing and behavioral characteristics and the work environment (outdoors in the sun or shade), also taking into account heat acclimatization. Personal daily heat stress risk levels and behavioral suggestions (hydration and work breaks recommended) to be taken into consideration in the short term (5 days) are provided together with long-term heat risk forecasts (up to 46 days), all which are useful for planning work activities.

Germany,Towards a Generic Residential Building Model for Heat-Health Warning Systems.,"Jens Pfafferott, Sascha Rißmann, Guido Halbig, Franz Schröder, Sascha Saad","A strong heat load in buildings and cities during the summer is not a new phenomenon. However, prolonged heat waves and increasing urbanization are intensifying the heat island effect in our cities; hence, the heat exposure in residential buildings. The thermophysiological load in the interior and exterior environments can be reduced in the medium and long term, through urban planning and building physics measures. In the short term, an increasingly vulnerable population must be effectively informed of an impending heat wave. Building simulation models can be favorably used to evaluate indoor heat stress. This study presents a generic simulation model, developed from monitoring data in urban multi-unit residential buildings during a summer period and using statistical methods. The model determines both the average room temperature and its deviations and, thus, consists of three sub-models: cool, average, and warm building types. The simulation model is based on the same mathematical algorithm, whereas each building type is described by a specific data set, concerning its building physical parameters and user behavior, respectively. The generic building model may be used in urban climate analyses with many individual buildings distributed across the city or in heat-health warning systems, with different building and user types distributed across a region. An urban climate analysis (with weather data from a database) may evaluate local differences in urban and indoor climate, whereas heat-health warning systems (driven by a weather forecast) obtain additional information on indoor heat stress and its expected deviations."

Italy,Performances of Limited Area Models for the WORKLIMATE Heat-Health Warning System to Protect Worker's Health and Productivity in Italy.,"Daniele Grifoni, Alessandro Messeri, Alfonso Crisci, Michela Bonafede, Francesco Pasi, Bernardo Gozzini, Simone Orlandini, Alessandro Marinaccio, Riccardo Mari, Marco Morabito","Outdoor workers are particularly exposed to climate conditions, and in particular, the increase of environmental temperature directly affects their health and productivity. For these reasons, in recent years, heat-health warning systems have been developed for workers generally using heat stress indicators obtained by the combination of meteorological parameters to describe the thermal stress induced by the outdoor environment on the human body. There are several studies on the verification of the parameters predicted by meteorological models, but very few relating to the validation of heat stress indicators. This study aims to verify the performance of two limited area models, with different spatial resolution, potentially applicable in the occupational heat health warning system developed within the WORKLIMATE project for the Italian territory. A comparison between the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature predicted by the models and that obtained by data from 28 weather stations was carried out over about three summer seasons in different daily time slots, using the most common skill of performance. The two meteorological models were overall comparable for much of the Italian explored territory, while major limits have emerged in areas with complex topography. This study demonstrated the applicability of limited area models in occupational heat health warning systems."
Italy,Heat warning and public and workers' health at the time of COVID-19 pandemic.,"Marco Morabito, Alessandro Messeri, Alfonso Crisci, Lorenza Pratali, Michela Bonafede, Alessandro Marinaccio","The humanity is currently facing the COVID-19 pandemic challenge, the largest global health emergency after the Second World War. During summer months, many countries in the northern hemisphere will also have to counteract an imminent seasonal phenomenon, the management of extreme heat events. The novelty this year concerns that the world population will have to deal with a new situation that foresees the application of specific measures, including adjunctive personal protective equipment (i.e. facemasks and gloves), in order to reduce the potential transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These measures should help to decrease the risk of the infection transmission but will also represent an aggravating factor to counteract the heat effects on the population health both at occupational and environmental level. The use of a specific heat health warning system with personalized information based on individual, behavioural and environmental characteristics represents a necessary strategy to help a fast adaptation of the population at a time where the priority is to live avoiding SARS-CoV-2 infection."

However, human health and performance are affected at much lower environmental heat strain levels than those directly associated with higher mortality. Moreover, workers are at elevated health risks when exposed to prolonged heat. This study describes the multilingual ""HEAT-SHIELD occupational warning system"" platform (https://heatshield.zonalab.it/) operating for Europe and developed within the framework of the HEAT-SHIELD project. This system is based on probabilistic medium-range forecasts calibrated on approximately 1800 meteorological stations in Europe and provides the ensemble forecast of the daily maximum heat stress. The platform provides a non-customized output represented by a map showing the weekly maximum probability of exceeding a specific heat stress condition, for each of the four upcoming weeks. Customized output allows the forecast of the personalized local heat-stress-risk based on workers' physical, clothing and behavioral characteristics and the work environment (outdoors in the sun or shade), also taking into account heat acclimatization. Personal daily heat stress risk levels and behavioral suggestions (hydration and work breaks recommended) to be taken into consideration in the short term (5 days) are provided together with long-term heat risk forecasts (up to 46 days), all which are useful for planning work activities. The HEAT-SHIELD platform provides adaptation strategies for ""managing"" the impact of global warming."

The joint collaboration of institutional agencies and multidisciplinary approaches is essential for a successful development of heat-health warning systems and action plans which can reduce the impacts of extreme heat on the population. The present work constitutes a state-of-the-art review of 16 European heat-health warning systems and heat-health action plans, based on the existing literature, web search (over the National Meteorological Services websites) and questionnaires. The aim of this study is to pave the way for future heat-health warning systems, such as the one currently under development in the framework of the Horizon 2020 HEAT-SHIELD project.

Italy,Heat-related mortality in the Florentine area (Italy) before and after the exceptional 2003 heat wave in Europe: an improved public health response?,"Marco Morabito, Francesco Profili, Alfonso Crisci, Paolo Francesconi, Gian Franco Gensini, Simone Orlandini","High ambient temperatures have been associated with increased mortality across the world. Several studies suggest that timely preventive measures may reduce heat-related excess mortality. The main aim of this study was to detect the temporal modification of heat-related mortality, in older adults (aged 65-74) and in elderly ≥75 years old, in the Florentine area by comparing previous (1999-2002) and subsequent (2004-2007) periods to the summer of 2003, when a regional Heat-Health Warning System (HHWS) was set up. Mortality data from 1999 to 2007 (May-September) were provided by the Mortality Registry of the Tuscany Region (n = 21,092). Weather data were used to assess daily apparent temperatures (AT). Case-crossover time-stratified designs and constrained segmented distributed lag models were applied. No significant heat-related mortality odds ratio (OR) variations were observed among the sub-periods. Nevertheless, a general OR decrease dating from 1999-2002 (OR 1.23; lack of HHWS) to 2004-2005 (OR 1.21; experimental HHWS running only for Florence) and to 2006-2007 (OR 1.12; official HHWS extended to the whole Florentine area) was observed when the maximum AT was considered. This modification was only evident in subjects ≥75 years old. The heat effect was higher and sustained for more days (until lag 9) during the period 1999-2002 than 2004-2007. The decrease of the excessive heat effect on mortality between periods with the absence and existence of a HHWS is also probably due to the mitigation of preventive measures and the implementation of a HHWS with specific interventions for safeguarding the health of the ""frail elderly""."

Nevertheless, a general OR decrease dating from 1999-2002 (OR 1.23; lack of HHWS) to 2004-2005 (OR 1.21; experimental HHWS running only for Florence) and to 2006-2007 (OR 1.12; official HHWS extended to the whole Florentine area) was observed when the maximum AT was considered. This modification was only evident in subjects ≥75 years old. The heat effect was higher and sustained for more days (until lag 9) during the period 1999-2002 than 2004-2007. The decrease of the excessive heat effect on mortality between periods with the absence and existence of a HHWS is also probably due to the mitigation of preventive measures and the implementation of a HHWS with specific interventions for safeguarding the health of the ""frail elderly""."

Under all future climate change models, extreme heat events will continue to increase in frequency, duration, and intensity. Evidence from previous extreme heat events across the globe demonstrates that adverse cardiovascular events are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly amongst the elderly and those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. However, less is understood about the adverse effects of extreme heat amongst specific cardiovascular diseases (i.e., heart failure, dysrhythmias) and demographics (sex, ethnicity, age) within Australia and New Zealand. Furthermore, although Australia has implemented regional and state heat warning systems, most personal heat-health protective advice available in public health policy documents is either insufficient, not grounded in scientific evidence, and/or does not consider clinical factors such as age or co-morbidities. Dissemination of evidence-based recommendations and enhancing community resilience to extreme heat disasters within Australia and New Zealand should be an area of critical focus to reduce the burden and negative health effects associated with extreme heat. This narrative review will focus on five key areas in relation to extreme heat events within Australia and New Zealand: 1) the potential physiological mechanisms that cause adverse cardiovascular outcomes during extreme heat events; 2) how big is the problem within Australia and New Zealand?; 3) what the heat-health response plans are; 4) research knowledge and translation; and, 5) knowledge gaps and areas for future research."

For these reasons, in recent years, heat-health warning systems have been developed for workers generally using heat stress indicators obtained by the combination of meteorological parameters to describe the thermal stress induced by the outdoor environment on the human body. There are several studies on the verification of the parameters predicted by meteorological models, but very few relating to the validation of heat stress indicators. This study aims to verify the performance of two limited area models, with different spatial resolution, potentially applicable in the occupational heat health warning system developed within the WORKLIMATE project for the Italian territory. A comparison between the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature predicted by the models and that obtained by data from 28 weather stations was carried out over about three summer seasons in different daily time slots, using the most common skill of performance. The two meteorological models were overall comparable for much of the Italian explored territory, while major limits have emerged in areas with complex topography. This study demonstrated the applicability of limited area models in occupational heat health warning systems."

Malaysia,The Scorching Truth: Investigating the Impact of Heatwaves on Selangor's Elderly Hospitalisations.,"Kun Hing Yong, Yen Nee Teo, Mohsen Azadbakht, Hai Phung, Cordia Chu","Global climate change has contributed to the intensity, frequency, and duration of heatwave events. The association between heatwaves and elderly mortality is highly researched in developed countries. In contrast, heatwave impact on hospital admissions has been insufficiently studied worldwide due to data availability and sensitivity. In our opinion, the relationship between heatwaves and hospital admissions is worthwhile to explore as it could have a profound impact on healthcare systems. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the associations between heatwaves and hospitalisations for the elderly by age group in Selangor, Malaysia, from 2010 to 2020. We further explored the impact of heatwaves on the risks of cause-specific hospital admissions across age groups within the elderly. This study applied generalized additive models (GAMs) with the Poisson family and distributed lag models (DLMs) to estimate the effect of heatwaves on hospitalisations. According to the findings, there was no significant increase in hospitalisations for those aged 60 and older during heatwaves; however, a rise in mean apparent temperature (ATmean) by 1 °C significantly increased the risk of hospital admission by 12.9%. Heatwaves had no immediate effects on hospital admissions among elderly patients, but significant delay effects were identified for ATmean with a lag of 0-3 days. The hospital admission rates of the elderly groups started declining after a 5-day average following the heatwave event. Females were found to be relatively more vulnerable than males during heatwave periods. Consequently, these results can provide a reference to improve public health strategies to target elderly people who are at the greatest risk of hospitalisations due to heatwaves. Development of early heatwave and health warning systems for the elderly would assist with preventing and reducing health risks while also minimising the burden on the whole hospital system in Selangor, Malaysia."

Australia,The Scorching Truth: Investigating the Impact of Heatwaves on Selangor's Elderly Hospitalisations.,"Kun Hing Yong, Yen Nee Teo, Mohsen Azadbakht, Hai Phung, Cordia Chu","Global climate change has contributed to the intensity, frequency, and duration of heatwave events. The association between heatwaves and elderly mortality is highly researched in developed countries. In contrast, heatwave impact on hospital admissions has been insufficiently studied worldwide due to data availability and sensitivity. In our opinion, the relationship between heatwaves and hospital admissions is worthwhile to explore as it could have a profound impact on healthcare systems. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the associations between heatwaves and hospitalisations for the elderly by age group in Selangor, Malaysia, from 2010 to 2020. We further explored the impact of heatwaves on the risks of cause-specific hospital admissions across age groups within the elderly. This study applied generalized additive models (GAMs) with the Poisson family and distributed lag models (DLMs) to estimate the effect of heatwaves on hospitalisations. According to the findings, there was no significant increase in hospitalisations for those aged 60 and older during heatwaves; however, a rise in mean apparent temperature (ATmean) by 1 °C significantly increased the risk of hospital admission by 12.9%. Heatwaves had no immediate effects on hospital admissions among elderly patients, but significant delay effects were identified for ATmean with a lag of 0-3 days. The hospital admission rates of the elderly groups started declining after a 5-day average following the heatwave event. Females were found to be relatively more vulnerable than males during heatwave periods. Consequently, these results can provide a reference to improve public health strategies to target elderly people who are at the greatest risk of hospitalisations due to heatwaves. Development of early heatwave and health warning systems for the elderly would assist with preventing and reducing health risks while also minimising the burden on the whole hospital system in Selangor, Malaysia."
Australia,Extreme Heat and Adverse Cardiovascular Outcomes in Australia and New Zealand: What Do We Know?,"Georgia K Chaseling, Nathan B Morris, Nicholas Ravanelli","Extreme heat events are a leading natural hazard risk to human health. Under all future climate change models, extreme heat events will continue to increase in frequency, duration, and intensity. Evidence from previous extreme heat events across the globe demonstrates that adverse cardiovascular events are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly amongst the elderly and those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. However, less is understood about the adverse effects of extreme heat amongst specific cardiovascular diseases (i.e., heart failure, dysrhythmias) and demographics (sex, ethnicity, age) within Australia and New Zealand. Furthermore, although Australia has implemented regional and state heat warning systems, most personal heat-health protective advice available in public health policy documents is either insufficient, not grounded in scientific evidence, and/or does not consider clinical factors such as age or co-morbidities. Dissemination of evidence-based recommendations and enhancing community resilience to extreme heat disasters within Australia and New Zealand should be an area of critical focus to reduce the burden and negative health effects associated with extreme heat. This narrative review will focus on five key areas in relation to extreme heat events within Australia and New Zealand: 1) the potential physiological mechanisms that cause adverse cardiovascular outcomes during extreme heat events; 2) how big is the problem within Australia and New Zealand?; 3) what the heat-health response plans are; 4) research knowledge and translation; and, 5) knowledge gaps and areas for future research."
Australia,Evaluation of climate change adaptation measures for childhood asthma: A systematic review of epidemiological evidence.,"Yabin Hu, Jian Cheng, Shijian Liu, Jianguo Tan, Chonghuai Yan, Guangjun Yu, Yong Yin, Shilu Tong","Global climate change (GCC) is widely accepted as the biggest threat to human health of the 21st century. Children are particularly vulnerable to GCC due to developing organ systems, psychological immaturity, nature of daily activities, and higher level of per-body-unit exposure. There is a rising trend in the disease burden of childhood asthma and allergies in many parts of the world. The associations of CC, air pollution and other environmental exposures with childhood asthma are attracting more research attention, but relatively few studies have focused on CC adaptation measures and childhood asthma. This study aimed to bridge this knowledge gap and conducted the first systematic review on CC adaptation measures and childhood asthma. We searched electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science using a set of MeSH terms and related synonyms, and identified 20 eligible studies included for review. We found that there were a number of adaptation measures proposed for childhood asthma in response to GCC, including vulnerability assessment, improving ventilation and heating, enhancing community education, and developing forecast models and early warning systems. Several randomized controlled trials show that improving ventilation and installing heating in the homes appear to be an effective way to relieve childhood asthma symptoms, especially in winter. However, the effectiveness of most adaptation measures, except for improving ventilation and heating, have not been explored and quantified. Given more extreme weather events (e.g., cold spells and heatwaves) may occur as climate change progresses, this finding may have important implications. Evidently, further research is urgently warranted to evaluate the impacts of CC adaptation measures on childhood asthma. These adaptation measures, if proven to be effective, should be integrated in childhood asthma control and prevention programs as GCC continues."

The model confirms the considerable benefit of discriminating nutrient-enriched areas that contain corals with enlarged (suboptimal) symbiont densities for the purpose of identifying bleaching-sensitive reef locations. The benefit of the new system-level understanding is showcased in terms of: (i) improving early-warning forecasts of summer bleaching risk, (ii) explaining historical bleaching patterns, (iii) testing the bleaching-resistant quality of the current marine protected area (MPA) network (iv) identifying routinely monitored coral health attributes, such as the tissue energy reserves and skeletal growth characteristics (viz. density and extension rates) that correlate with bleaching resistant reef locations, and (v) targeting region-specific water quality improvement strategies that may increase reef-scale coral health and bleaching resistance."

Australia,Impact of heatwave on mortality under different heatwave definitions: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Zhiwei Xu, Gerard FitzGerald, Yuming Guo, Bin Jalaludin, Shilu Tong","Heatwave effects on human health and wellbeing is a great public health concern, especially in the context of climate change. However, no universally consistent heatwave definition is available. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the heatwave definitions used in the literature published up to 1st April 2015 by searching five databases (PubMed, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science). Random-effects models were used to pool the effects of heatwave on total and cardiorespiratory mortality by different heatwave definitions. Existing evidence suggests a significant impact of heatwave on mortality, but the magnitude of the effect estimates varies under different heatwave definitions. Heatwave-related mortality risks increased by 4% (using ""mean temperatures ≥95th percentile for ≥2days"" as a heatwave definition), 3% (mean temperatures ≥98th percentile for ≥2days), 7% (mean temperatures ≥99th percentile for ≥2days) and 16% (mean temperatures ≥97th percentile for ≥5days). Heatwave intensity plays a relatively more important role than duration in determining heatwave-related deaths. Heatwaves significantly increase mortality across the globe, but the effect estimates vary with the definition of heatwaves. City- or region-specific heat health early warning systems based on identified local heatwave definitions may be optimal for protecting and preventing people from the adverse impacts of future heatwaves."

Australia,Are heat warning systems effective?,"Ghasem Sam Toloo, Gerard Fitzgerald, Peter Aitken, Kenneth Verrall, Shilu Tong","Heatwaves are associated with significant health risks particularly among vulnerable groups. To minimize these risks, heat warning systems have been implemented. The question therefore is how effective these systems are in saving lives and reducing heat-related harm. We systematically searched and reviewed 15 studies which examined this. Six studies asserted that fewer people died of excessive heat after the implementation of heat warning systems. Demand for ambulance decreased following the implementation of these systems. One study also estimated the costs of running heat warning systems at US$210,000 compared to the US$468 million benefits of saving 117 lives. The remaining eight studies investigated people's response to heat warning systems and taking appropriate actions against heat harms. Perceived threat of heat dangers emerged as the main factor related to heeding the warnings and taking proper actions. However, barriers, such as costs of running air-conditioners, were of significant concern, particularly to the poor. The weight of the evidence suggests that heat warning systems are effective in reducing mortality and, potentially, morbidity. However, their effectiveness may be mediated by cognitive, emotive and socio-demographic characteristics. More research is urgently required into the cost-effectiveness of heat warning systems' measures and improving the utilization of the services."

However, no universally consistent heatwave definition is available. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the heatwave definitions used in the literature published up to 1st April 2015 by searching five databases (PubMed, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science). Random-effects models were used to pool the effects of heatwave on total and cardiorespiratory mortality by different heatwave definitions. Existing evidence suggests a significant impact of heatwave on mortality, but the magnitude of the effect estimates varies under different heatwave definitions. Heatwave-related mortality risks increased by 4% (using ""mean temperatures ≥95th percentile for ≥2days"" as a heatwave definition), 3% (mean temperatures ≥98th percentile for ≥2days), 7% (mean temperatures ≥99th percentile for ≥2days) and 16% (mean temperatures ≥97th percentile for ≥5days).

Australia,Are heat warning systems effective?,"Ghasem Sam Toloo, Gerard Fitzgerald, Peter Aitken, Kenneth Verrall, Shilu Tong","Heatwaves are associated with significant health risks particularly among vulnerable groups. To minimize these risks, heat warning systems have been implemented. The question therefore is how effective these systems are in saving lives and reducing heat-related harm. We systematically searched and reviewed 15 studies which examined this. Six studies asserted that fewer people died of excessive heat after the implementation of heat warning systems. Demand for ambulance decreased following the implementation of these systems. One study also estimated the costs of running heat warning systems at US$210,000 compared to the US$468 million benefits of saving 117 lives. The remaining eight studies investigated people's response to heat warning systems and taking appropriate actions against heat harms. Perceived threat of heat dangers emerged as the main factor related to heeding the warnings and taking proper actions. However, barriers, such as costs of running air-conditioners, were of significant concern, particularly to the poor. The weight of the evidence suggests that heat warning systems are effective in reducing mortality and, potentially, morbidity. However, their effectiveness may be mediated by cognitive, emotive and socio-demographic characteristics. More research is urgently required into the cost-effectiveness of heat warning systems' measures and improving the utilization of the services."

Australia,The Scorching Truth: Investigating the Impact of Heatwaves on Selangor's Elderly Hospitalisations.,"Kun Hing Yong, Yen Nee Teo, Mohsen Azadbakht, Hai Phung, Cordia Chu","Global climate change has contributed to the intensity, frequency, and duration of heatwave events. The association between heatwaves and elderly mortality is highly researched in developed countries. In contrast, heatwave impact on hospital admissions has been insufficiently studied worldwide due to data availability and sensitivity. In our opinion, the relationship between heatwaves and hospital admissions is worthwhile to explore as it could have a profound impact on healthcare systems. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the associations between heatwaves and hospitalisations for the elderly by age group in Selangor, Malaysia, from 2010 to 2020. We further explored the impact of heatwaves on the risks of cause-specific hospital admissions across age groups within the elderly. This study applied generalized additive models (GAMs) with the Poisson family and distributed lag models (DLMs) to estimate the effect of heatwaves on hospitalisations. According to the findings, there was no significant increase in hospitalisations for those aged 60 and older during heatwaves; however, a rise in mean apparent temperature (ATmean) by 1 °C significantly increased the risk of hospital admission by 12.9%. Heatwaves had no immediate effects on hospital admissions among elderly patients, but significant delay effects were identified for ATmean with a lag of 0-3 days. The hospital admission rates of the elderly groups started declining after a 5-day average following the heatwave event. Females were found to be relatively more vulnerable than males during heatwave periods. Consequently, these results can provide a reference to improve public health strategies to target elderly people who are at the greatest risk of hospitalisations due to heatwaves. Development of early heatwave and health warning systems for the elderly would assist with preventing and reducing health risks while also minimising the burden on the whole hospital system in Selangor, Malaysia."
Australia,Extreme Heat and Adverse Cardiovascular Outcomes in Australia and New Zealand: What Do We Know?,"Georgia K Chaseling, Nathan B Morris, Nicholas Ravanelli","Extreme heat events are a leading natural hazard risk to human health. Under all future climate change models, extreme heat events will continue to increase in frequency, duration, and intensity. Evidence from previous extreme heat events across the globe demonstrates that adverse cardiovascular events are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly amongst the elderly and those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. However, less is understood about the adverse effects of extreme heat amongst specific cardiovascular diseases (i.e., heart failure, dysrhythmias) and demographics (sex, ethnicity, age) within Australia and New Zealand. Furthermore, although Australia has implemented regional and state heat warning systems, most personal heat-health protective advice available in public health policy documents is either insufficient, not grounded in scientific evidence, and/or does not consider clinical factors such as age or co-morbidities. Dissemination of evidence-based recommendations and enhancing community resilience to extreme heat disasters within Australia and New Zealand should be an area of critical focus to reduce the burden and negative health effects associated with extreme heat. This narrative review will focus on five key areas in relation to extreme heat events within Australia and New Zealand: 1) the potential physiological mechanisms that cause adverse cardiovascular outcomes during extreme heat events; 2) how big is the problem within Australia and New Zealand?; 3) what the heat-health response plans are; 4) research knowledge and translation; and, 5) knowledge gaps and areas for future research."

Children are particularly vulnerable to GCC due to developing organ systems, psychological immaturity, nature of daily activities, and higher level of per-body-unit exposure. There is a rising trend in the disease burden of childhood asthma and allergies in many parts of the world. The associations of CC, air pollution and other environmental exposures with childhood asthma are attracting more research attention, but relatively few studies have focused on CC adaptation measures and childhood asthma. This study aimed to bridge this knowledge gap and conducted the first systematic review on CC adaptation measures and childhood asthma. We searched electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science using a set of MeSH terms and related synonyms, and identified 20 eligible studies included for review. We found that there were a number of adaptation measures proposed for childhood asthma in response to GCC, including vulnerability assessment, improving ventilation and heating, enhancing community education, and developing forecast models and early warning systems. Several randomized controlled trials show that improving ventilation and installing heating in the homes appear to be an effective way to relieve childhood asthma symptoms, especially in winter. However, the effectiveness of most adaptation measures, except for improving ventilation and heating, have not been explored and quantified. Given more extreme weather events (e.g., cold spells and heatwaves) may occur as climate change progresses, this finding may have important implications. Evidently, further research is urgently warranted to evaluate the impacts of CC adaptation measures on childhood asthma. These adaptation measures, if proven to be effective, should be integrated in childhood asthma control and prevention programs as GCC continues."

Australia,Evaluating the effectiveness of heat warning systems: systematic review of epidemiological evidence.,"Ghasem Toloo, Gerard FitzGerald, Peter Aitken, Kenneth Verrall, Shilu Tong",To review the existing research on the effectiveness of heat warning systems (HWSs) in saving lives and reducing harm.
Australia,Are heat warning systems effective?,"Ghasem Sam Toloo, Gerard Fitzgerald, Peter Aitken, Kenneth Verrall, Shilu Tong","Heatwaves are associated with significant health risks particularly among vulnerable groups. To minimize these risks, heat warning systems have been implemented. The question therefore is how effective these systems are in saving lives and reducing heat-related harm. We systematically searched and reviewed 15 studies which examined this. Six studies asserted that fewer people died of excessive heat after the implementation of heat warning systems. Demand for ambulance decreased following the implementation of these systems. One study also estimated the costs of running heat warning systems at US$210,000 compared to the US$468 million benefits of saving 117 lives. The remaining eight studies investigated people's response to heat warning systems and taking appropriate actions against heat harms. Perceived threat of heat dangers emerged as the main factor related to heeding the warnings and taking proper actions. However, barriers, such as costs of running air-conditioners, were of significant concern, particularly to the poor. The weight of the evidence suggests that heat warning systems are effective in reducing mortality and, potentially, morbidity. However, their effectiveness may be mediated by cognitive, emotive and socio-demographic characteristics. More research is urgently required into the cost-effectiveness of heat warning systems' measures and improving the utilization of the services."
Australia,"The effects of summer temperature, age and socioeconomic circumstance on acute myocardial infarction admissions in Melbourne, Australia.","Margaret E Loughnan, Neville Nicholls, Nigel J Tapper","Published literature detailing the effects of heatwaves on human health is readily available. However literature describing the effects of heat on morbidity is less plentiful, as is research describing events in the southern hemisphere and Australia in particular. To identify susceptible populations and direct public health responses research must move beyond description of the temperature morbidity relationship to include social and spatial risk factors. This paper presents a spatial and socio-demographic picture of the effects of hot weather on persons admitted to hospital with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in Melbourne."

Portugal,Assessing the use and understanding of the Portuguese heat-health warning system (ÍCARO).,"A Leite, A J Santos, S Silva, B Nunes, R Mexia, A P Rodrigues","Heatwaves can lead to increased mortality. In the Portuguese heat-health warning system (HHWS), ÍCARO, a daily report with heat-related mortality prediction is sent to heat-health action plan (HHAP) practitioners. HHAP practitioners assess risk and implement measures to prevent heatwave-related impact, but ÍCARO's use and understanding are unknown. We assessed ÍCARO's use and understanding by key HHAP practitioners."
Portugal,The new automated daily mortality surveillance system in Portugal.,"P J Nogueira, A Machado, E Rodrigues, B Nunes, L Sousa, M Jacinto, A Ferreira, J M Falcao, P Ferrinho","The experience reported in an earlier Eurosurveillance issue on a fast method to evaluate the impact of the 2003 heatwave on mortality in Portugal, generated a daily mortality surveillance system (VDM) that has been operating ever since jointly with the Portuguese Heat Health Watch Warning System. This work describes the VDM system and how it evolved to become an automated system operating year-round, and shows briefly its potential using mortality data from January 2006 to June 2009 collected by the system itself. The new system has important advantages such as: rapid information acquisition, completeness (the entire population is included), lightness (very little information is exchanged, date of death, age, sex, place of death registration). It allows rapid detection of impacts (within five days) and allows a quick preliminary quantification of impacts that usually took several years to be done. These characteristics make this system a powerful tool for public health action. The VDM system also represents an example of inter-institutional cooperation, bringing together organisations from two different ministries, Health and Justice, aiming at improving knowledge about the mortality in the population."

Denmark,The unprecedented 2022 extreme summer heatwaves increased harmful cyanobacteria blooms.,"Na Li, Yunlin Zhang, Yibo Zhang, Kun Shi, Haiming Qian, Huayin Yang, Yongkang Niu, Boqiang Qin, Guangwei Zhu, R Iestyn Woolway, Erik Jeppesen","Heatwaves are increasing and expected to intensify in coming decades with global warming. However, direct evidence and knowledge of the mechanisms of the effects of heatwaves on harmful cyanobacteria blooms are limited and unclear. In 2022, we measured chlorophyll-a (Chla) at 20-s intervals based on a novel ground-based proximal sensing system (GBPSs) in the shallow eutrophic Lake Taihu and combined in situ Chla measurements with meteorological data to explore the impacts of heatwaves on cyanobacterial blooms and the potential relevant mechanisms. We found that three unprecedented summer heatwaves (July 4-15, July 22-August 16, and August 18-23) lasting a total of 44 days were observed with average maximum air temperatures (MATs) of 38.1 ± 1.9 °C, 38.7 ± 1.9 °C, and 40.2 ± 2.1 °C, respectively, and that these heatwaves were characterized by high air temperature, strong PAR, low wind speed and rainfall. The daily Chla significantly increased with increasing MAT and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and decreasing wind speed, revealing a clear promotion effect on harmful cyanobacteria blooms from the heatwaves. Moreover, the combined effects of high temperature, strong PAR and low wind, enhanced the stability of the water column, the light availability and the phosphorus release from the sediment which ultimately boosted cyanobacteria blooms. The projected increase in heatwave occurrence under future climate change underscores the urgency of reducing nutrient input to eutrophic lakes to combat cyanobacteria growth and of improving early warning systems to ensure secure water management."

However, direct evidence and knowledge of the mechanisms of the effects of heatwaves on harmful cyanobacteria blooms are limited and unclear. In 2022, we measured chlorophyll-a (Chla) at 20-s intervals based on a novel ground-based proximal sensing system (GBPSs) in the shallow eutrophic Lake Taihu and combined in situ Chla measurements with meteorological data to explore the impacts of heatwaves on cyanobacterial blooms and the potential relevant mechanisms. We found that three unprecedented summer heatwaves (July 4-15, July 22-August 16, and August 18-23) lasting a total of 44 days were observed with average maximum air temperatures (MATs) of 38.1 ± 1.9 °C, 38.7 ± 1.9 °C, and 40.2 ± 2.1 °C, respectively, and that these heatwaves were characterized by high air temperature, strong PAR, low wind speed and rainfall. The daily Chla significantly increased with increasing MAT and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and decreasing wind speed, revealing a clear promotion effect on harmful cyanobacteria blooms from the heatwaves. Moreover, the combined effects of high temperature, strong PAR and low wind, enhanced the stability of the water column, the light availability and the phosphorus release from the sediment which ultimately boosted cyanobacteria blooms. The projected increase in heatwave occurrence under future climate change underscores the urgency of reducing nutrient input to eutrophic lakes to combat cyanobacteria growth and of improving early warning systems to ensure secure water management."

South Africa,An analysis of past and future heatwaves based on a heat-associated mortality threshold: towards a heat health warning system.,"Thandi Kapwata, Michael T Gebreslasie, Caradee Y Wright","Heatwaves can have severe impacts on human health extending from illness to mortality. These health effects are related to not only the physical phenomenon of heat itself but other characteristics such as frequency, intensity, and duration of heatwaves. Therefore, understanding heatwave characteristics is a crucial step in the development of heat-health warning systems (HHWS) that could prevent or reduce negative heat-related health outcomes. However, there are no South African studies that have quantified heatwaves with a threshold that incorporated a temperature metric based on a health outcome. To fill this gap, this study aimed to assess the spatial and temporal distribution and frequency of past (2014 - 2019) and future (period 2020 - 2039) heatwaves across South Africa. Heatwaves were defined using a threshold for diurnal temperature range (DTR) that was found to have measurable impacts on mortality. In the current climate, inland provinces experienced fewer heatwaves of longer duration and greater intensity compared to coastal provinces that experienced heatwaves of lower intensity. The highest frequency of heatwaves occurred during the austral summer accounting for a total of 150 events out of 270 from 2014 to 2019. The heatwave definition applied in this study also identified severe heatwaves across the country during late 2015 to early 2016 which was during the strongest El Niño event ever recorded to date. Record-breaking global temperatures were reported during this period; the North West province in South Africa was the worst affected experiencing heatwaves ranging from 12 to 77 days. Future climate analysis showed increasing trends in heatwave events with the greatest increases (80%-87%) expected to occur during summer months. The number of heatwaves occurring in cooler seasons is expected to increase with more events projected from the winter months of July and August, onwards. The findings of this study show that the identification of provinces and towns that experience intense, long-lasting heatwaves is crucial to inform development and implementation of targeted heat-health adaptation strategies. These findings could also guide authorities to prioritise vulnerable population groups such as the elderly and children living in high-risk areas likely to be affected by heatwaves."

Slovenia,Steps Towards Comprehensive Heat Communication in the Frame of a Heat Health Warning System in Slovenia.,"Tjaša Pogačar, Zala Žnidaršič, Lučka Kajfež Bogataj, Zalika Črepinšek","Occupational heat stress has an important negative impact on the well-being, health and productivity of workers and should; therefore, be recognized as a public health issue in Europe. There is no comprehensive heat health warning system in Slovenia combining public health measures with meteorological forecasts. The aim of this research was to provide insight into the development of such a system in Slovenia, turning the communication from the current meteoalarm into a broader system that has more information for different social groups. To achieve this goal, the following steps were used: Analysis of summer temperatures and issued meteoalarms, a survey of the general knowledge about heat among the public, organization and management of two stakeholder symposia, and a final survey on workers' opinions on heat stress and measures, supplemented by interviews with employers. Summer average daily temperature distributions in Slovenia changed during the investigated period (1961-2019) and the mean values increased over time by 2-3 °C. Additionally, the number of days with fulfilled yellow (potentially dangerous) and especially orange (dangerous) meteoalarm conditions increased significantly after 1990. The survey of the general public about heat stress and warnings showed that efforts to raise awareness of heat issues need to be intensified and that public health measures should effectively target vulnerable groups. Stakeholder symposia and further surveys have shown that awareness and understanding of the negative effects of heat stress on health and productivity are still quite low, so effective ways of disseminating information to different sectors while striking the best balance between efficiency, feasibility and economic cost have to be found."

China,[A review on heat-wave early warning based on population health risk].,"C Chen, J Liu, Y Zhong, T T Li","Global warming has caused frequent heat waves worldwide. In order to respond to heat waves and enhance the public's protection abilities, Europe, the United States and other countries have extensively carried out research on heat-health early warning, and initially achieved good health benefits based on a heat-health early warning system. However, the research on heat-health early warning is still limited in China, especially on health risks at the population level. Based on evidence-based thinking, our study combs the research progress of heat-health early warning from four aspects: early warning indicators, early warning models, early warning thresholds, and early warning ranks, and clarifies the key points of the construction of heat-health early warning models and rank schemes, in order to provide early warning technology for the rapid development of national heat-heath early warning in China."

China,Evaluation of climate change adaptation measures for childhood asthma: A systematic review of epidemiological evidence.,"Yabin Hu, Jian Cheng, Shijian Liu, Jianguo Tan, Chonghuai Yan, Guangjun Yu, Yong Yin, Shilu Tong","Global climate change (GCC) is widely accepted as the biggest threat to human health of the 21st century. Children are particularly vulnerable to GCC due to developing organ systems, psychological immaturity, nature of daily activities, and higher level of per-body-unit exposure. There is a rising trend in the disease burden of childhood asthma and allergies in many parts of the world. The associations of CC, air pollution and other environmental exposures with childhood asthma are attracting more research attention, but relatively few studies have focused on CC adaptation measures and childhood asthma. This study aimed to bridge this knowledge gap and conducted the first systematic review on CC adaptation measures and childhood asthma. We searched electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science using a set of MeSH terms and related synonyms, and identified 20 eligible studies included for review. We found that there were a number of adaptation measures proposed for childhood asthma in response to GCC, including vulnerability assessment, improving ventilation and heating, enhancing community education, and developing forecast models and early warning systems. Several randomized controlled trials show that improving ventilation and installing heating in the homes appear to be an effective way to relieve childhood asthma symptoms, especially in winter. However, the effectiveness of most adaptation measures, except for improving ventilation and heating, have not been explored and quantified. Given more extreme weather events (e.g., cold spells and heatwaves) may occur as climate change progresses, this finding may have important implications. Evidently, further research is urgently warranted to evaluate the impacts of CC adaptation measures on childhood asthma. These adaptation measures, if proven to be effective, should be integrated in childhood asthma control and prevention programs as GCC continues."

China,Abrupt shift to hotter and drier climate over inner East Asia beyond the tipping point.,"Peng Zhang, Jee-Hoon Jeong, Jin-Ho Yoon, Hyungjun Kim, S-Y Simon Wang, Hans W Linderholm, Keyan Fang, Xiuchen Wu, Deliang Chen","Unprecedented heatwave-drought concurrences in the past two decades have been reported over inner East Asia. Tree-ring-based reconstructions of heatwaves and soil moisture for the past 260 years reveal an abrupt shift to hotter and drier climate over this region. Enhanced land-atmosphere coupling, associated with persistent soil moisture deficit, appears to intensify surface warming and anticyclonic circulation anomalies, fueling heatwaves that exacerbate soil drying. Our analysis demonstrates that the magnitude of the warm and dry anomalies compounding in the recent two decades is unprecedented over the quarter of a millennium, and this trend clearly exceeds the natural variability range. The ""hockey stick""-like change warns that the warming and drying concurrence is potentially irreversible beyond a tipping point in the East Asian climate system."
China,Performance of heat-health warning systems in Shanghai evaluated by using local heat-related illness data.,"Yaqiao Wu, Xiaoye Wang, Jingyan Wu, Rui Wang, Saini Yang","In response to more frequent heatwaves, various regional or national heat-health warning systems (HHWSs) have been developed recently as adaptation measures. A wide range of methodologies have been utilized to issue warnings, as there is no universal definition of ""heat event"" or ""heatwave"", nor are there quantified thresholds of human-health tolerance to extreme weather. The performance of these warning systems has rarely been evaluated with actual heat-health data, especially the morbidity data, in regions with severe impact. In this study, we assessed the performance of the Shanghai HHWS based on heat-related illness data collected by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) and then conducted a comparative analysis among the Shanghai HHWS, the China Meteorological Administration HHWS, the Chinese national standard for heatwave indexes, the heat index adopted by the USA's National Weather Service and the definition suggested by the World Meteorological Organization to understand their potential performance for application in Shanghai and to evaluate the temperature thresholds and different meteorological indices employed. The results show that: 1) during the research period, 50% of heat-related illnesses and 58.2% of heat-related deaths in Shanghai occurred on dates that had no heat warnings; 2) for the current threshold (35 °C), the single metric of temperature outperformed the temperature-duration two-parameter method; 3) different from existing studies, while infants and seniors are deemed as vulnerable population groups to heat, young and middle-aged males were found to suffer more heat-related illnesses in hot weather. More detailed analyses reveal that the performance of heat-health warning systems needs to be evaluated and revised periodically, and warning thresholds utilized must be localized to reflect public tolerance to heat and to address the vulnerability of target population groups. Temperature is the dominant threshold in heat-related morbidity and mortality analysis. While a decrease in the temperature threshold would definitely increase the warning frequency and socioeconomic costs, it might also cause warning fatigue. The trade-off between these two aspects is essential for decision-makers and other stakeholders in HHWS design and improvement."

China,"Impacts of extremely high temperature and heatwave on heatstroke in Chongqing, China.","Yonghong Li, Chengcheng Li, Shuquan Luo, Jinyu He, Yibin Cheng, Yinlong Jin","Few studies have reported the quantitative association between heat and heatstroke (HS) occurrence, particularly in China. The aim of this study was to quantitatively assess the association between high temperature/heatwave and HS occurrence in Chongqing. The daily HS data from 2009 to 2013 of Chongqing were extracted from Chongqing Center for Disease Control and Prevention. A Zero-inflated Poisson regression model (ZIP) with a logistic distribution was used to quantitatively analyze the impacts of the daily maximum temperature (Tmax) over the threshold on HS occurrence by gender, age, and severity of HS, after controlling for covariates including day of the week (DOW), relative humidity, and daily temperature range. Lag effects up to 10 days were analyzed. Heatwave intensity, which was classified into four levels according to the quartile of its values, was calculated by Tmax multiplied the duration of a heatwave. The excess risk of HS during heatwave with different intensity was analyzed. The Tmax threshold for HS was 34 °C in Chongqing. After adjusting for potential confounders, strong associations and age-specific lag effects between Tmax and daily HS occurrence were observed. The impacts of Tmax on total HS lasted for 7 days (lag0-6), with the highest excess risk (ER) value of 30.5% (95% CI 23.6 and 37.8%) on lag0 with each 1 °C increment in Tmax over the threshold. A slightly stronger temperature-HS association was detected in male compared to female. The population over 65 years had the highest ER and the younger adults aged 19-35 and 35-55 years also showed significant heat-HS associations. The number of daily cases increased with the increasing of duration of heatwave and the peak value occurred on the eleventh day of the heatwave. The excess risk of HS during the heatwave with 1 to 4 level of intensity increased by 2.54, 2.97, 5.61, and 11.3 times, respectively, as compared with that of non-heatwave. Extreme heat is becoming a huge threat to public health due to the strong temperature-HS associations in Chongqing. Climate change with increasing temperatures may make the situation worse. Our results can provide reference for developing and improving relevant public health strategies and early extreme weather and health warning system to prevent and reduce the health risks due to extreme weather and climate change in Chongqing."
China,Heat stroke internet searches can be a new heatwave health warning surveillance indicator.,"Tiantian Li, Fan Ding, Qinghua Sun, Yi Zhang, Patrick L Kinney","The impact of major heatwave shocks on population morbidity and mortality has become an urgent public health concern. However, Current heatwave warning systems suffer from a lack of validation and an inability to provide accurate health risk warnings in a timely way. Here we conducted a correlation and linear regression analysis to test the relationship between heat stroke internet searches and heat stroke health outcomes in Shanghai, China, during the summer of 2013. We show that the resulting heatstroke index captures much of the variation in heat stroke cases and deaths. The correlation between heat stroke deaths, the search index and the incidence of heat stroke is higher than the correlation with maximum temperature. This study highlights a fast and effective heatwave health warning indicator with potential to be used throughout the world."

Slovenia,Steps Towards Comprehensive Heat Communication in the Frame of a Heat Health Warning System in Slovenia.,"Tjaša Pogačar, Zala Žnidaršič, Lučka Kajfež Bogataj, Zalika Črepinšek","Occupational heat stress has an important negative impact on the well-being, health and productivity of workers and should; therefore, be recognized as a public health issue in Europe. There is no comprehensive heat health warning system in Slovenia combining public health measures with meteorological forecasts. The aim of this research was to provide insight into the development of such a system in Slovenia, turning the communication from the current meteoalarm into a broader system that has more information for different social groups. To achieve this goal, the following steps were used: Analysis of summer temperatures and issued meteoalarms, a survey of the general knowledge about heat among the public, organization and management of two stakeholder symposia, and a final survey on workers' opinions on heat stress and measures, supplemented by interviews with employers. Summer average daily temperature distributions in Slovenia changed during the investigated period (1961-2019) and the mean values increased over time by 2-3 °C. Additionally, the number of days with fulfilled yellow (potentially dangerous) and especially orange (dangerous) meteoalarm conditions increased significantly after 1990. The survey of the general public about heat stress and warnings showed that efforts to raise awareness of heat issues need to be intensified and that public health measures should effectively target vulnerable groups. Stakeholder symposia and further surveys have shown that awareness and understanding of the negative effects of heat stress on health and productivity are still quite low, so effective ways of disseminating information to different sectors while striking the best balance between efficiency, feasibility and economic cost have to be found."

China,The unprecedented 2022 extreme summer heatwaves increased harmful cyanobacteria blooms.,"Na Li, Yunlin Zhang, Yibo Zhang, Kun Shi, Haiming Qian, Huayin Yang, Yongkang Niu, Boqiang Qin, Guangwei Zhu, R Iestyn Woolway, Erik Jeppesen","Heatwaves are increasing and expected to intensify in coming decades with global warming. However, direct evidence and knowledge of the mechanisms of the effects of heatwaves on harmful cyanobacteria blooms are limited and unclear. In 2022, we measured chlorophyll-a (Chla) at 20-s intervals based on a novel ground-based proximal sensing system (GBPSs) in the shallow eutrophic Lake Taihu and combined in situ Chla measurements with meteorological data to explore the impacts of heatwaves on cyanobacterial blooms and the potential relevant mechanisms. We found that three unprecedented summer heatwaves (July 4-15, July 22-August 16, and August 18-23) lasting a total of 44 days were observed with average maximum air temperatures (MATs) of 38.1 ± 1.9 °C, 38.7 ± 1.9 °C, and 40.2 ± 2.1 °C, respectively, and that these heatwaves were characterized by high air temperature, strong PAR, low wind speed and rainfall. The daily Chla significantly increased with increasing MAT and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and decreasing wind speed, revealing a clear promotion effect on harmful cyanobacteria blooms from the heatwaves. Moreover, the combined effects of high temperature, strong PAR and low wind, enhanced the stability of the water column, the light availability and the phosphorus release from the sediment which ultimately boosted cyanobacteria blooms. The projected increase in heatwave occurrence under future climate change underscores the urgency of reducing nutrient input to eutrophic lakes to combat cyanobacteria growth and of improving early warning systems to ensure secure water management."
China,[A review on heat-wave early warning based on population health risk].,"C Chen, J Liu, Y Zhong, T T Li","Global warming has caused frequent heat waves worldwide. In order to respond to heat waves and enhance the public's protection abilities, Europe, the United States and other countries have extensively carried out research on heat-health early warning, and initially achieved good health benefits based on a heat-health early warning system. However, the research on heat-health early warning is still limited in China, especially on health risks at the population level. Based on evidence-based thinking, our study combs the research progress of heat-health early warning from four aspects: early warning indicators, early warning models, early warning thresholds, and early warning ranks, and clarifies the key points of the construction of heat-health early warning models and rank schemes, in order to provide early warning technology for the rapid development of national heat-heath early warning in China."

China,Evaluation of climate change adaptation measures for childhood asthma: A systematic review of epidemiological evidence.,"Yabin Hu, Jian Cheng, Shijian Liu, Jianguo Tan, Chonghuai Yan, Guangjun Yu, Yong Yin, Shilu Tong","Global climate change (GCC) is widely accepted as the biggest threat to human health of the 21st century. Children are particularly vulnerable to GCC due to developing organ systems, psychological immaturity, nature of daily activities, and higher level of per-body-unit exposure. There is a rising trend in the disease burden of childhood asthma and allergies in many parts of the world. The associations of CC, air pollution and other environmental exposures with childhood asthma are attracting more research attention, but relatively few studies have focused on CC adaptation measures and childhood asthma. This study aimed to bridge this knowledge gap and conducted the first systematic review on CC adaptation measures and childhood asthma. We searched electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science using a set of MeSH terms and related synonyms, and identified 20 eligible studies included for review. We found that there were a number of adaptation measures proposed for childhood asthma in response to GCC, including vulnerability assessment, improving ventilation and heating, enhancing community education, and developing forecast models and early warning systems. Several randomized controlled trials show that improving ventilation and installing heating in the homes appear to be an effective way to relieve childhood asthma symptoms, especially in winter. However, the effectiveness of most adaptation measures, except for improving ventilation and heating, have not been explored and quantified. Given more extreme weather events (e.g., cold spells and heatwaves) may occur as climate change progresses, this finding may have important implications. Evidently, further research is urgently warranted to evaluate the impacts of CC adaptation measures on childhood asthma. These adaptation measures, if proven to be effective, should be integrated in childhood asthma control and prevention programs as GCC continues."

China,Abrupt shift to hotter and drier climate over inner East Asia beyond the tipping point.,"Peng Zhang, Jee-Hoon Jeong, Jin-Ho Yoon, Hyungjun Kim, S-Y Simon Wang, Hans W Linderholm, Keyan Fang, Xiuchen Wu, Deliang Chen","Unprecedented heatwave-drought concurrences in the past two decades have been reported over inner East Asia. Tree-ring-based reconstructions of heatwaves and soil moisture for the past 260 years reveal an abrupt shift to hotter and drier climate over this region. Enhanced land-atmosphere coupling, associated with persistent soil moisture deficit, appears to intensify surface warming and anticyclonic circulation anomalies, fueling heatwaves that exacerbate soil drying. Our analysis demonstrates that the magnitude of the warm and dry anomalies compounding in the recent two decades is unprecedented over the quarter of a millennium, and this trend clearly exceeds the natural variability range. The ""hockey stick""-like change warns that the warming and drying concurrence is potentially irreversible beyond a tipping point in the East Asian climate system."
China,Performance of heat-health warning systems in Shanghai evaluated by using local heat-related illness data.,"Yaqiao Wu, Xiaoye Wang, Jingyan Wu, Rui Wang, Saini Yang","In response to more frequent heatwaves, various regional or national heat-health warning systems (HHWSs) have been developed recently as adaptation measures. A wide range of methodologies have been utilized to issue warnings, as there is no universal definition of ""heat event"" or ""heatwave"", nor are there quantified thresholds of human-health tolerance to extreme weather. The performance of these warning systems has rarely been evaluated with actual heat-health data, especially the morbidity data, in regions with severe impact. In this study, we assessed the performance of the Shanghai HHWS based on heat-related illness data collected by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) and then conducted a comparative analysis among the Shanghai HHWS, the China Meteorological Administration HHWS, the Chinese national standard for heatwave indexes, the heat index adopted by the USA's National Weather Service and the definition suggested by the World Meteorological Organization to understand their potential performance for application in Shanghai and to evaluate the temperature thresholds and different meteorological indices employed. The results show that: 1) during the research period, 50% of heat-related illnesses and 58.2% of heat-related deaths in Shanghai occurred on dates that had no heat warnings; 2) for the current threshold (35 °C), the single metric of temperature outperformed the temperature-duration two-parameter method; 3) different from existing studies, while infants and seniors are deemed as vulnerable population groups to heat, young and middle-aged males were found to suffer more heat-related illnesses in hot weather. More detailed analyses reveal that the performance of heat-health warning systems needs to be evaluated and revised periodically, and warning thresholds utilized must be localized to reflect public tolerance to heat and to address the vulnerability of target population groups. Temperature is the dominant threshold in heat-related morbidity and mortality analysis. While a decrease in the temperature threshold would definitely increase the warning frequency and socioeconomic costs, it might also cause warning fatigue. The trade-off between these two aspects is essential for decision-makers and other stakeholders in HHWS design and improvement."

The aim of this study was to quantitatively assess the association between high temperature/heatwave and HS occurrence in Chongqing. The daily HS data from 2009 to 2013 of Chongqing were extracted from Chongqing Center for Disease Control and Prevention. A Zero-inflated Poisson regression model (ZIP) with a logistic distribution was used to quantitatively analyze the impacts of the daily maximum temperature (Tmax) over the threshold on HS occurrence by gender, age, and severity of HS, after controlling for covariates including day of the week (DOW), relative humidity, and daily temperature range. Lag effects up to 10 days were analyzed. Heatwave intensity, which was classified into four levels according to the quartile of its values, was calculated by Tmax multiplied the duration of a heatwave. The excess risk of HS during heatwave with different intensity was analyzed. The Tmax threshold for HS was 34 °C in Chongqing. After adjusting for potential confounders, strong associations and age-specific lag effects between Tmax and daily HS occurrence were observed. The impacts of Tmax on total HS lasted for 7 days (lag0-6), with the highest excess risk (ER) value of 30.5% (95% CI 23.6 and 37.8%) on lag0 with each 1 °C increment in Tmax over the threshold. A slightly stronger temperature-HS association was detected in male compared to female. The population over 65 years had the highest ER and the younger adults aged 19-35 and 35-55 years also showed significant heat-HS associations. The number of daily cases increased with the increasing of duration of heatwave and the peak value occurred on the eleventh day of the heatwave. The excess risk of HS during the heatwave with 1 to 4 level of intensity increased by 2.54, 2.97, 5.61, and 11.3 times, respectively, as compared with that of non-heatwave. Extreme heat is becoming a huge threat to public health due to the strong temperature-HS associations in Chongqing. Climate change with increasing temperatures may make the situation worse. Our results can provide reference for developing and improving relevant public health strategies and early extreme weather and health warning system to prevent and reduce the health risks due to extreme weather and climate change in Chongqing."

India,"Projected climate extremes over agro-climatic zones of Ganga River Basin under 1.5, 2, and 3° global warming levels.","Harsh Vardhan Singh, Nitin Joshi, Shakti Suryavanshi","Recurring floods, droughts, heatwaves, and other hydro-meteorological extreme events are likely to be increased under the climate change scenarios. The increased risk of these extreme events might have more exposure to the population; thus, it is important to discuss such extreme events and their projected behavior under a changing climate scenario. In the present study, we have computed the extreme precipitation and temperature indices over the 10 agro-climatic zones falling under the Ganga River Basin (GRB)utilizing a high-resolution daily gridded temperature and precipitation multi-model ensembled CMIP6 dataset (0.25° × 0.25°) under global warming levels of 1.5 °C, 2 °C, and 3 °C. We found that the annual daily minimum temperature (TNN) showed a higher rise of about 67% than the maximum temperature (TXX) of 48% in GRB. The basin also experiences a greater increase in the frequency of warm nights (TN90P) of about 67.71% compared to warm days (TX90P) of 29.1% for the 3 °C global warming level. Along with extreme indices, the population exposed due to the impact of the extreme maximum temperature has also been analyzed for progressive warming levels. Population exposure to extreme temperature event (TXX) has been analyzed with 20-year return period using GEV distribution method. The study concludes that the exposed population to extreme temperature event experienced an increase from 46.99 to 52.16% for the whole Ganga Basin. Consecutive dry days (CDD) and consecutive wet days (CWD) both show a significant increasing trend, but CWD has a significant increase in the majority of the zones, while CDD shows a significant decreasing trend for some of the zones for three warming levels periods. Extreme climate indices help to understand the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall, droughts, and heatwaves to develop early warning systems and adaptation strategies to mitigate such events."

The results show that: 1) during the research period, 50% of heat-related illnesses and 58.2% of heat-related deaths in Shanghai occurred on dates that had no heat warnings; 2) for the current threshold (35 °C), the single metric of temperature outperformed the temperature-duration two-parameter method; 3) different from existing studies, while infants and seniors are deemed as vulnerable population groups to heat, young and middle-aged males were found to suffer more heat-related illnesses in hot weather. More detailed analyses reveal that the performance of heat-health warning systems needs to be evaluated and revised periodically, and warning thresholds utilized must be localized to reflect public tolerance to heat and to address the vulnerability of target population groups. Temperature is the dominant threshold in heat-related morbidity and mortality analysis. While a decrease in the temperature threshold would definitely increase the warning frequency and socioeconomic costs, it might also cause warning fatigue. The trade-off between these two aspects is essential for decision-makers and other stakeholders in HHWS design and improvement."

China,Heatwave and elderly mortality: An evaluation of death burden and health costs considering short-term mortality displacement.,"Jian Cheng, Zhiwei Xu, Hilary Bambrick, Hong Su, Shilu Tong, Wenbiao Hu","A heatwave can be a devastating natural disaster to human health, and elderly people are particularly vulnerable. With the continuing rise in earth's surface temperature alongside the world's aging population, research on the mortality burden of heatwave for the older population remains relatively sparse. The potential magnitude of benefits of averting such deaths may be considerable."

China,"Impacts of extremely high temperature and heatwave on heatstroke in Chongqing, China.","Yonghong Li, Chengcheng Li, Shuquan Luo, Jinyu He, Yibin Cheng, Yinlong Jin","Few studies have reported the quantitative association between heat and heatstroke (HS) occurrence, particularly in China. The aim of this study was to quantitatively assess the association between high temperature/heatwave and HS occurrence in Chongqing. The daily HS data from 2009 to 2013 of Chongqing were extracted from Chongqing Center for Disease Control and Prevention. A Zero-inflated Poisson regression model (ZIP) with a logistic distribution was used to quantitatively analyze the impacts of the daily maximum temperature (Tmax) over the threshold on HS occurrence by gender, age, and severity of HS, after controlling for covariates including day of the week (DOW), relative humidity, and daily temperature range. Lag effects up to 10 days were analyzed. Heatwave intensity, which was classified into four levels according to the quartile of its values, was calculated by Tmax multiplied the duration of a heatwave. The excess risk of HS during heatwave with different intensity was analyzed. The Tmax threshold for HS was 34 °C in Chongqing. After adjusting for potential confounders, strong associations and age-specific lag effects between Tmax and daily HS occurrence were observed. The impacts of Tmax on total HS lasted for 7 days (lag0-6), with the highest excess risk (ER) value of 30.5% (95% CI 23.6 and 37.8%) on lag0 with each 1 °C increment in Tmax over the threshold. A slightly stronger temperature-HS association was detected in male compared to female. The population over 65 years had the highest ER and the younger adults aged 19-35 and 35-55 years also showed significant heat-HS associations. The number of daily cases increased with the increasing of duration of heatwave and the peak value occurred on the eleventh day of the heatwave. The excess risk of HS during the heatwave with 1 to 4 level of intensity increased by 2.54, 2.97, 5.61, and 11.3 times, respectively, as compared with that of non-heatwave. Extreme heat is becoming a huge threat to public health due to the strong temperature-HS associations in Chongqing. Climate change with increasing temperatures may make the situation worse. Our results can provide reference for developing and improving relevant public health strategies and early extreme weather and health warning system to prevent and reduce the health risks due to extreme weather and climate change in Chongqing."
China,Heat stroke internet searches can be a new heatwave health warning surveillance indicator.,"Tiantian Li, Fan Ding, Qinghua Sun, Yi Zhang, Patrick L Kinney","The impact of major heatwave shocks on population morbidity and mortality has become an urgent public health concern. However, Current heatwave warning systems suffer from a lack of validation and an inability to provide accurate health risk warnings in a timely way. Here we conducted a correlation and linear regression analysis to test the relationship between heat stroke internet searches and heat stroke health outcomes in Shanghai, China, during the summer of 2013. We show that the resulting heatstroke index captures much of the variation in heat stroke cases and deaths. The correlation between heat stroke deaths, the search index and the incidence of heat stroke is higher than the correlation with maximum temperature. This study highlights a fast and effective heatwave health warning indicator with potential to be used throughout the world."
China,"Influence of heat wave definitions to the added effect of heat waves on daily mortality in Nanjing, China.","Kai Chen, Jun Bi, Jin Chen, Xiaodong Chen, Lei Huang, Lian Zhou","Few studies have explored the added effect of heat waves, especially in China. Moreover, no prior studies have assessed whether the choice of heat wave definitions affected this added effect. This study compared the associations between heat waves defined by different heat wave definitions (HWs) and cause-specific mortality in warm season in Nanjing, China."
China,An operational heat/health warning system in Shanghai.,"Jianguo Tan, L S Kalkstein, Jiaxin Huang, Songbai Lin, Hebao Yin, Demin Shao","Previous research has noted that high surface temperatures within certain ""offensive"" air masses can lead to increased mortality. This study assesses the relationship between daily mortality rates and weather within the city of Shanghai, China, while introducing an operational heat/health warning system for the city. Using numerous meteorological observations, the spatial synoptic classification has been used to classify each summer day from 1989 to 1998 into one of eight air mass types for Shanghai. Through the comparative analysis of the daily air mass type and the corresponding Shanghai mortality rate, ""moist tropical plus"" (MT+), an extremely hot and humid air mass, was identified as an offensive air mass with the highest rates of mortality. Using stepwise regression, an algorithm was produced to help predict the number of excess deaths that will occur with each occurrence of the MT+ airmass. The heat/health warning system was run experimentally in the summer of 2001 and illustrated that the use of a warning system can alert the city's residents of potentially offensive weather situations that can lead to a deterioration in human health."
India,"Projected climate extremes over agro-climatic zones of Ganga River Basin under 1.5, 2, and 3° global warming levels.","Harsh Vardhan Singh, Nitin Joshi, Shakti Suryavanshi","Recurring floods, droughts, heatwaves, and other hydro-meteorological extreme events are likely to be increased under the climate change scenarios. The increased risk of these extreme events might have more exposure to the population; thus, it is important to discuss such extreme events and their projected behavior under a changing climate scenario. In the present study, we have computed the extreme precipitation and temperature indices over the 10 agro-climatic zones falling under the Ganga River Basin (GRB)utilizing a high-resolution daily gridded temperature and precipitation multi-model ensembled CMIP6 dataset (0.25° × 0.25°) under global warming levels of 1.5 °C, 2 °C, and 3 °C. We found that the annual daily minimum temperature (TNN) showed a higher rise of about 67% than the maximum temperature (TXX) of 48% in GRB. The basin also experiences a greater increase in the frequency of warm nights (TN90P) of about 67.71% compared to warm days (TX90P) of 29.1% for the 3 °C global warming level. Along with extreme indices, the population exposed due to the impact of the extreme maximum temperature has also been analyzed for progressive warming levels. Population exposure to extreme temperature event (TXX) has been analyzed with 20-year return period using GEV distribution method. The study concludes that the exposed population to extreme temperature event experienced an increase from 46.99 to 52.16% for the whole Ganga Basin. Consecutive dry days (CDD) and consecutive wet days (CWD) both show a significant increasing trend, but CWD has a significant increase in the majority of the zones, while CDD shows a significant decreasing trend for some of the zones for three warming levels periods. Extreme climate indices help to understand the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall, droughts, and heatwaves to develop early warning systems and adaptation strategies to mitigate such events."

Translating the non-linear function between heat and health effects into an effective threshold for heat warnings to protect the population is a challenge. We present a systematic analysis of heat indicators in relation to mortality. We applied distributed lag non-linear models in an individual-level case-crossover design to assess the effects of heat on mortality in Switzerland during the warm season from 2003 to 2016 for three temperature metrics (daily mean, maximum, and minimum temperature), and various threshold temperatures and heatwave definitions. Individual death records with information on residential address from the Swiss National Cohort were linked to high-resolution temperature estimates from 100 m resolution maps. Moderate (90th percentile) to extreme thresholds (99.5th percentile) of the three temperature metrics implied a significant increase in mortality (5 to 38%) in respect of the median warm-season temperature. Effects of the threshold temperatures on mortality were similar across the seven major regions in Switzerland. Heatwave duration did not modify the effect when considering delayed effects up to 7 days. This nationally representative study, accounting for small-scale exposure variability, suggests that the national heat-warning system should focus on heatwave intensity rather than duration.

Translating the non-linear function between heat and health effects into an effective threshold for heat warnings to protect the population is a challenge. We present a systematic analysis of heat indicators in relation to mortality. We applied distributed lag non-linear models in an individual-level case-crossover design to assess the effects of heat on mortality in Switzerland during the warm season from 2003 to 2016 for three temperature metrics (daily mean, maximum, and minimum temperature), and various threshold temperatures and heatwave definitions. Individual death records with information on residential address from the Swiss National Cohort were linked to high-resolution temperature estimates from 100 m resolution maps. Moderate (90th percentile) to extreme thresholds (99.5th percentile) of the three temperature metrics implied a significant increase in mortality (5 to 38%) in respect of the median warm-season temperature. Effects of the threshold temperatures on mortality were similar across the seven major regions in Switzerland. Heatwave duration did not modify the effect when considering delayed effects up to 7 days. This nationally representative study, accounting for small-scale exposure variability, suggests that the national heat-warning system should focus on heatwave intensity rather than duration.

However, human health and performance are affected at much lower environmental heat strain levels than those directly associated with higher mortality. Moreover, workers are at elevated health risks when exposed to prolonged heat. This study describes the multilingual ""HEAT-SHIELD occupational warning system"" platform (https://heatshield.zonalab.it/) operating for Europe and developed within the framework of the HEAT-SHIELD project. This system is based on probabilistic medium-range forecasts calibrated on approximately 1800 meteorological stations in Europe and provides the ensemble forecast of the daily maximum heat stress. The platform provides a non-customized output represented by a map showing the weekly maximum probability of exceeding a specific heat stress condition, for each of the four upcoming weeks. Customized output allows the forecast of the personalized local heat-stress-risk based on workers' physical, clothing and behavioral characteristics and the work environment (outdoors in the sun or shade), also taking into account heat acclimatization. Personal daily heat stress risk levels and behavioral suggestions (hydration and work breaks recommended) to be taken into consideration in the short term (5 days) are provided together with long-term heat risk forecasts (up to 46 days), all which are useful for planning work activities.

The present work constitutes a state-of-the-art review of 16 European heat-health warning systems and heat-health action plans, based on the existing literature, web search (over the National Meteorological Services websites) and questionnaires.

Sweden,Wet Bulb Globe Temperature: Indicating Extreme Heat Risk on a Global Grid.,"Chloe Brimicombe, Chun Hay Brian Lo, Florian Pappenberger, Claudia Di Napoli, Pedro Maciel, Tiago Quintino, Rosalind Cornforth, Hannah L Cloke","The Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) is an international standard heat index used by the health, industrial, sports, and climate sectors to assess thermal comfort during heat extremes. Observations of its components, the globe and the wet bulb temperature (WBT), are however sparse. Therefore WBGT is difficult to derive, making it common to rely on approximations, such as the ones developed by Liljegren et al. (2008, https://doi.org/10.1080/15459620802310770, "
Sweden,Abrupt shift to hotter and drier climate over inner East Asia beyond the tipping point.,"Peng Zhang, Jee-Hoon Jeong, Jin-Ho Yoon, Hyungjun Kim, S-Y Simon Wang, Hans W Linderholm, Keyan Fang, Xiuchen Wu, Deliang Chen","Unprecedented heatwave-drought concurrences in the past two decades have been reported over inner East Asia. Tree-ring-based reconstructions of heatwaves and soil moisture for the past 260 years reveal an abrupt shift to hotter and drier climate over this region. Enhanced land-atmosphere coupling, associated with persistent soil moisture deficit, appears to intensify surface warming and anticyclonic circulation anomalies, fueling heatwaves that exacerbate soil drying. Our analysis demonstrates that the magnitude of the warm and dry anomalies compounding in the recent two decades is unprecedented over the quarter of a millennium, and this trend clearly exceeds the natural variability range. The ""hockey stick""-like change warns that the warming and drying concurrence is potentially irreversible beyond a tipping point in the East Asian climate system."
Sweden,[High mortality during the 2018 heatwave in Sweden].,"Christofer Åström, Pär Bjelkmar, Bertil Forsberg","During the summer of 2018 large parts of Sweden experienced a record-breaking heatwave regarding temperatures and duration. Previous studies from Sweden with less extreme heat have shown that daily mortality is expected to increase during periods with high temperatures.  Between the 2nd of July and 5th of August, the period in 2018 with the highest temperatures, 635 more deaths were observed in Sweden compared to the same period in 2017. This corresponds to an 8,2% increase over the entire heatwave, and a 13,5% increase during the warmest week, the 16th to 22nd of July.  When using temperature data from four weather stations and relative risks from the models established for the Swedish heatwave early warning system, the heat episode in the summer of 2018 could be expected to result in 601-746 excess deaths, depending on model choice. Comparison with the observed mortality data therefore confirm the ability of the risk models to predict the expected increase in mortality also during longer periods with higher temperatures than ever studied before in Sweden."

Sweden,Developing a heatwave early warning system for Sweden: evaluating sensitivity of different epidemiological modelling approaches to forecast temperatures.,"Christofer Åström, Kristie L Ebi, Joakim Langner, Bertil Forsberg","Over the last two decades a number of heatwaves have brought the need for heatwave early warning systems (HEWS) to the attention of many European governments. The HEWS in Europe are operating under the assumption that there is a high correlation between observed and forecasted temperatures. We investigated the sensitivity of different temperature mortality relationships when using forecast temperatures. We modelled mortality in Stockholm using observed temperatures and made predictions using forecast temperatures from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts to assess the sensitivity. We found that the forecast will alter the expected future risk differently for different temperature mortality relationships. The more complex models seemed more sensitive to inaccurate forecasts. Despite the difference between models, there was a high agreement between models when identifying risk-days. We find that considerations of the accuracy in temperature forecasts should be part of the design of a HEWS. Currently operating HEWS do evaluate their predictive performance; this information should also be part of the evaluation of the epidemiological models that are the foundation in the HEWS. The most accurate description of the relationship between high temperature and mortality might not be the most suitable or practical when incorporated into a HEWS."
Sweden,Heatwave early warning systems and adaptation advice to reduce human health consequences of heatwaves.,"Dianne Lowe, Kristie L Ebi, Bertil Forsberg","With climate change, there has been an increase in the frequency, intensity and duration of heatwave events. In response to the devastating mortality and morbidity of recent heatwave events, many countries have introduced heatwave early warning systems (HEWS). HEWS are designed to reduce the avoidable human health consequences of heatwaves through timely notification of prevention measures to vulnerable populations."

Translating the non-linear function between heat and health effects into an effective threshold for heat warnings to protect the population is a challenge. We present a systematic analysis of heat indicators in relation to mortality. We applied distributed lag non-linear models in an individual-level case-crossover design to assess the effects of heat on mortality in Switzerland during the warm season from 2003 to 2016 for three temperature metrics (daily mean, maximum, and minimum temperature), and various threshold temperatures and heatwave definitions. Individual death records with information on residential address from the Swiss National Cohort were linked to high-resolution temperature estimates from 100 m resolution maps. Moderate (90th percentile) to extreme thresholds (99.5th percentile) of the three temperature metrics implied a significant increase in mortality (5 to 38%) in respect of the median warm-season temperature. Effects of the threshold temperatures on mortality were similar across the seven major regions in Switzerland. Heatwave duration did not modify the effect when considering delayed effects up to 7 days. This nationally representative study, accounting for small-scale exposure variability, suggests that the national heat-warning system should focus on heatwave intensity rather than duration. While a different heat-warning indicator may be appropriate in other countries, our evaluation framework is transferable to any country."

Republic of Korea,"Analysis on Effectiveness of Impact Based Heatwave Warning Considering Severity and Likelihood of Health Impacts in Seoul, Korea.","Yeora Chae, Jongchul Park","Many countries are operating a heatwave warning system (HWWS) to mitigate the impact of heatwaves on human health. The level of heatwave warning is normally determined by using the threshold temperature of heat-related morbidity or mortality. However, morbidity and mortality threshold temperatures have not been used together to account for the severity of health impacts. In this study, we developed a heatwave warning system with two different warning levels: Level-1 and Level-2, by analyzing the severity and likelihood of heat-related morbidity and mortality using the generalized additive model. The study particularly focuses on the cases in Seoul, South Korea, between 2011 and 2018. The study found that the threshold temperature for heat-related morbidity and mortality are 30 °C and 33 °C, respectively. Approximately 73.1% of heat-related patients visited hospitals when temperature was between 30 °C and 33 °C. We validated the developed HWWS by using both the threshold temperatures of morbidity and mortality. The area under curves (AUCs) of the proposed model were 0.74 and 0.86 at Level-1 and Level-2, respectively. On the other hand, the AUCs of the model using only the mortality threshold were 0.60 and 0.86 at Level-1 and Level-2, respectively. The AUCs of the model using only the morbidity threshold were 0.73 and 0.78 at Level-1 and Level-2, respectively. The results suggest that the updated HWWS can help to reduce the impact of heatwaves, particularly on vulnerable groups, by providing the customized information. This also indicates that the HWWS could effectively mitigate the risk of morbidity and mortality."
Republic of Korea,Effects of heat waves on daily excess mortality in 14 Korean cities during the past 20 years (1991-2010): an application of the spatial synoptic classification approach.,"Dae-Geun Lee, Kyu Rang Kim, Jiyoung Kim, Baek-Jo Kim, Chun-Ho Cho, Scott C Sheridan, Laurence S Kalkstein, Ho Kim, Seung-Muk Yi","The aims of this study are to explore the ""offensive"" summer weather types classified under the spatial synoptic classification (SSC) system and to evaluate their impacts on excess mortality in 14 Korean cities. All-cause deaths per day for the entire population were examined over the summer months (May-September) of 1991-2010. Daily deaths were standardized to account for long-term trends of subcycles (annual, seasonal, and weekly) at the mid-latitudes. In addition, a mortality prediction model was constructed through multiple stepwise regression to develop a heat-health warning system based on synoptic climatology. The result showed that dry tropical (DT) days during early summer caused excess mortality due to non-acclimatization by inhabitants, and moist tropical (MT) plus and double plus resulted in greater spikes of excess mortality due to extremely hot and humid conditions. Among the 14 Korean cities, highly excess mortality for the elderly was observed in Incheon (23.2%, 95%CI 5.6), Seoul (15.8%, 95%CI 2.6), and Jeonju (15.8%, 95%CI 4.6). No time lag effect was observed, and excess mortality gradually increased with time and hot weather simultaneously. The model showed weak performance as its predictions were underestimated for the validation period (2011-2015). Nevertheless, the results clearly revealed the efficiency of relative and multiple-variable approaches better than absolute and single-variable approaches. The results indicate the potential of the SSC as a suitable system for investigating heat vulnerability in South Korea, where hot summers could be a significant risk factor."
